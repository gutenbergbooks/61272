WOMAN IN THE BAZAAR</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_I" id="CHAPTER_I"></a>CHAPTER I</h2>

<p class="h2a">THE VICAR'S DAUGHTER</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Summer-time</span> at Under-edge compensated, in a
measure, for the trials and severities of winter--for
winter could be grim and cruel in the isolated
little Cotswold village approached by roads that
were almost perpendicular. Why such a spot
should ever have been fixed upon for human habitation
seemed difficult to comprehend, save that in
old and dangerous days its very inaccessibility
may have been its chief attraction; most of the
villagers were descendants of gypsies, outlaws,
and highwaymen. Now, at the close of the nineteenth
century, no one, unless held by custom
and tradition, or by lack of means, remained permanently
at Under-edge; for communication with
the world in the valley below was still conducted
by carrier, postal arrangements were awkward and
uncertain, water very often scarce, and existence
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page2" id="page2"></a>[pg&nbsp;2]</span>
during winter-time a long-drawn period of bleak
and hard monotony.</p>

<p class="indent">But when the vast fields, bounded by rough
stone walls, grew green and luscious, and the oaks
put forth new foliage the colour of a young pea-pod,
and the elm trunks sprouted feathery sprays
that likened the trees to gigantic Houdan fowls,
life in Under-edge became at least endurable. Even
the dilapidated vicarage looked charming, wistaria
draping the old walls in mauve cascades, and white
montana creeper heaped above the porch; roses
and passion flower climbed and clung to broken
trellis-work, and outside the dining-room window
the magnolia tree, planted by a former vicar many
years ago, filled the air with lemon scent from
waxen cups. Though the garden was unkempt,
the grass so seldom mown, and the path unweeded,
hardy perennials brightened the neglected flower-beds,
and lilac, syringa, laburnum, flourished in
sweet luxuriance. It was a paradise for birds,
whose trilling echoed clear from dawn to sunset
in this safe retreat.</p>

<p class="indent">Rafella Forte, the vicar's daughter, came out
of the house this summer morning in a blue cotton
frock that matched her eyes, wearing no hat on
her yellow head. A coarse market basket was
slung on her arm, and she carried a light pronged
fork, since her object was not to cut flowers for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page3" id="page3"></a>[pg&nbsp;3]</span>
the drawing-room vases, as would seem natural
for a young lady, but to dig potatoes for the midday
meal. The potato patch was perhaps the most
useful portion of the vicarage garden, and it meant
real disaster if the crop was scanty, since the living
of Under-edge, though not quite so miserable as
some, was yet poor enough to render the garden
produce of infinite value, in support of one joint a
week, an occasional hen that had ceased laying,
and sometimes a rabbit presented by a farmer.</p>

<p class="indent">Ella Forte was barely twenty-one, yet for years
had she worked, and scraped, and saved, so that
the little household--herself, her father, and a
single-handed servant--might subsist in tolerable
comfort; that there might be something still in
hand for parish claims, for possible emergencies,
for, at least, a passably respectable appearance.
She gloried in her management, she knew no discontent,
she was proud to fill the post surrendered
by her mother, who lay beneath a shrinking mound
in the churchyard just beyond the vicarage domain.
She was complacently convinced of her father's
dependence upon her, and of her influence in the
village, where she had no rival, for the squire's
house stood empty, closed, falling into disrepair,
its owner dwelling out of England, crippled by a
dwindling rent-roll and heavy charges on the
property.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page4" id="page4"></a>[pg&nbsp;4]</span>
This morning she sang blithely as she crossed
the lawn that more nearly resembled a hay-field--sang
one of the hymns she had selected for to-morrow's
service, to be led by herself to her own
strenuous accompaniment on the aged harmonium
and the raucous voices of the village congregation.
The sun shone on her hair, that glinted golden,
crinkling over her little head, gathered into a then
unfashionable knob at the nape of her slim, white
neck. And Captain Coventry, riding along the
road, looked over the privet hedge and thought he
had never beheld anything on this earth to compare
with its glory. Why, the girl's hair was
like &quot;kincob,&quot; like the border of a nautch woman's
veil, like the work on a rajah's robe!</p>

<p class="indent">Captain Coventry had just returned from India,
and the glamour of the East was still upon him--the
East that is so very different to look back upon
when a man's whole service need not be spent in
exile. Just now he was on short leave, and his
regiment--an English line regiment--would be returning
home in two years' time. India, to him,
was yet a pleasant quarter of the globe that meant
sport (his passion) well within his means, cheaper
comfort, cheaper living, amusements that were
welcome to his outdoor tastes, not to speak of
soldiering experiences of the finest next to active
service. He was on a visit to his widowed mother
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page5" id="page5"></a>[pg&nbsp;5]</span>
and his spinster sister, who lived in the little
country town lying at the base of the hills that
jutted out like monstrous knuckles over the Severn
Valley; and feeling slightly bored, in need of exercise,
of movement, he had hired a horse and was
exploring Cotswold villages on morning rides.</p>

<p class="indent">So it came about that on this perfect summer
day he had passed through Under-edge, and was
arrested now by the vision of a girl with golden
head and bright blue gown in the garden of a
wayside vicarage.</p>

<p class="indent">Involuntarily he checked his mount, and from
behind the hedge he watched the slim blue figure
move across the grass and stand for a moment outlined
against a door in an ivy-covered garden wall.
She was singing as she wrestled with a rusty
latch:</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i4">&quot;Other refuge have I none;</span>
<span class="i4">Hangs my helpless soul on Thee;</span>
<span class="i4">Leave, ah! leave me not alone,</span>
<span class="i4">Still support and comfort me.&quot;</span>
</div>
</div>

<p class="indent">How he wished he could see her face; he felt
he <i>must</i> see it! And when she had opened the
door and vanished from his view, he rode on
slowly, reluctantly, scheming how he might return
with some specious reason that would enable him
to speak with her.</p>

<p class="indent">George Coventry was not susceptible. Save for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page6" id="page6"></a>[pg&nbsp;6]</span>a youthful and hopeless love affair that left no
lasting impress on his heart, his life had been
exceptionally free from sexual distractions; he was
more on his guard against women than actually
indifferent to them. Without conceit, he was not
wholly unaware that he found favour, generally,
with females of his class, the very austereness of
his nature provoked and attracted them; but illicit
love repelled him, and, so far, since he had been
in a position to support a wife, no girl or woman
in particular had caught his fancy, though in the
abstract he was not averse to the notion of
marriage.</p>

<p class="indent">His ideal of womanhood was modelled on the
type represented by his mother and his aunts and
his spinster sister, ladies whose sole charm lay
in their personal virtue, the keynote of whose
lives was duty and devotion to the home. Coventry
was an only son, and on the death of his father
his mother's whole existence became centred on
himself, while Miss Coventry sacrificed youth and
pleasure and all outside interests in order that she
might minister undividedly to her bereaved parent;
and both women remained serenely unconscious
of the waste of life and energy and happiness that
the sacrifice entailed. The daughter refused a
proposal from a worthy gentleman because, she
said, she could not leave Mama; and her mother
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page7" id="page7"></a>[pg&nbsp;7]</span>
and her brother accepted this decision as only
right and proper. The suitor failing to suggest
that Mama should also become an inmate of his
house, the matter went no further. Such immolation
of female youth to age is common and unending,
and in the majority of cases the victim
lays down her natural rights on the altar of duty
with but little conception of the magnitude of the
offering, and receives small credit for her
martyrdom.</p>

<p class="indent">There had been something chaste and exquisite
about this maiden in the garden that had touched
a tender chord in George Coventry's breast. He
felt an inward certainty that the girl was gentle,
simple, sweet--a little saint, with her aureole of
hair, and her artless singing of the old familiar
hymn. The impression lured him so irresistibly
that he was several times on the point of turning
his horse's head, but each excuse that presented
itself struck him as too thin. He had lost his way--where
to? He had been suddenly taken ill, felt
faint; the very idea caused him to smile--he had
never felt faint in his life and did not know how
to enact the symptoms, and no one would for a
moment believe him to be ill, judging by his
appearance of hopelessly robust health! Perhaps
a cigarette would stimulate his imagination; he
put his hand in his pocket and encountered a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page8" id="page8"></a>[pg&nbsp;8]</span>
knife given him only yesterday by his sister for
his birthday--the kind of gift &quot;for a man&quot; above
which certain feminine minds seem unable to rise
when cigarette-cases, sleeve-links, tie-pins and
pocket-books have been exhausted. The knife was
a cumbersome plated article, comprising, in addition
to blades of all sizes, a corkscrew, folding
scissors, a button-hook, and an instrument intended
for the extraction of stones from horses' hoofs.
For once he blessed Nellie's limited notions of
masculine needs, because her present suggested a
plausible plea.</p>

<p class="indent">He dismounted and searched about the ground
for a pebble that might suit his purpose. Anyone
passing would have supposed that the big,
bronzed young man scraping in the dust of the
country road must have dropped some treasured
possession.</p>

<p class="indent">Presently he passed his hand with practised
touch down the horse's fetlock, and the animal
raised its hoof in docile response. Coventry
wedged a little stone between the hoof and the
shoe, then turned in the direction of the vicarage,
the bridle over his arm, the horse limping, ever
so slightly, behind him.</p>

<p class="indent">At the wooden entrance gate he paused. The
vicarage front door stood open, and across the
rough gravel sweep he could see into the hall--see
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page9" id="page9"></a>[pg&nbsp;9]</span>
a stone-paved floor and an oak chest, with
hats and coats hanging from hooks above it. A
rose-scented peace enveloped the house and garden;
he heard no sound save the high, clear calling
of birds.</p>

<p class="indent">A sudden reluctance assailed him, kept him
standing at the gate, his hand on the latch, his
heart beating fast; a fateful feeling that if he disturbed
this somnolent calm his whole life, his whole
future, would be affected, whether for evil or for
good. The horse nuzzled his shoulder gently, a
yellow butterfly skimmed past. He thought of
the girl's golden hair in the sunshine, and he
swung open the gate.</p>

<p class="indent">Ivy hid the door-bell, but he found it and pulled
boldly. The result was disconcerting; never had
he known a house-bell create such a clamour; it
clanged and re-echoed, and continued till he felt it
must surely rouse not only the vicarage but the
entire village. Long before its pealing ceased a
door was opened within, and an elderly cleric,
with a grey beard and a benevolent expression,
appeared in the porch.</p>

<p class="indent">Coventry raised his hat, apologised for his
intrusion, and explained.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;My horse,&quot; he said, &quot;has got a stone in his
hoof, and I'm a long way from home. Have you
anything you could lend me to get it out?&quot;<span class="pagenum"><a name="page10" id="page10"></a>[pg&nbsp;10]</span>
That was the beginning. The vicar was
cordially sympathetic, and at once went in search
of some instrument, returning with a pruning
knife, a skewer, and a chisel.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Perhaps one of these?&quot; he said, and then
stood by, remarking upon the weather and the
prospects of the fruit crop and the hay, and the
unusual heat, while with much apparent effort the
stone was extracted and cast aside.</p>

<p class="indent">Then Coventry stood up and mopped his
forehead.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes, the heat is extraordinary, I suppose, for
England, though of course it's nothing compared
with India.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Ah! So you have had some experience of the
tropics?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I'm home on leave from my regiment in
India.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The vicar was interested. &quot;Then, no doubt,&quot;
he said, &quot;you can tell me what headway conversion
to Christianity is making among the heathen? I
once contemplated joining an Indian mission
myself, but there were difficulties in the way--my
dear wife's health, the birth of my little
daughter, and so forth. But it is a subject that
has always attracted me strongly.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Coventry strove to recollect if he had ever conversed
with a missionary in India. &quot;I believe,&quot; he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page11" id="page11"></a>[pg&nbsp;11]</span>
uttered profoundly, &quot;that it is a very intricate
question.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Quite so; and at such a distance it is difficult
for stay-at-homes to understand the obstacles that
our brave workers have to encounter and overcome.
Idolatry, from all accounts, is a very formidable
foe. My daughter is just now organising a little
sale of work, to be held here next week, in aid of
foreign missions; we like to feel that, humble
parish as we are, we do our small share to help.
But I must not keep you standing in the sun.
Will you not take your horse round to the stables
and let us offer you a rest and some refreshment
before you go on your way?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Coventry displayed becoming hesitation. He
could not think of giving so much trouble, of
taking up the vicar's valuable time, though he
admitted that a short halt would not be altogether
unwelcome in view of the distance he had come
and the distance he had still to go. He permitted
himself to be persuaded, and his host conducted
him to the back of the house, to where a couple
of empty stalls and a coach-house almost in ruins
faced a weed-choked yard appropriated now by
poultry and some pigs.</p>

<p class="indent">They re-entered the house by the kitchen, that
had a red-brick floor, an open range, and black
beams across the low ceiling; they traversed a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page12" id="page12"></a>[pg&nbsp;12]</span>
long flagged passage, passed through a swing-door
that must once have been covered with green
baize, and thence across the hall to the vicar's
study. It was a cool and restful room despite its
shabby furniture and musty odour.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I always half expect to see my predecessor
sitting in my chair,&quot; the vicar told him whimsically.
&quot;He was here for nearly half a century. These
old vicarages are steeped in memories. I have
been here myself for over twenty years, and I still
feel as if I was a kind of interloper! Everything
is practically just the same as when I took the
living over. We move very slowly in these
benighted mountain villages.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Someone passed the open window.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Rafella!&quot; called the vicar.</p>

<p class="indent">Coventry held his breath. What a charming
name! Next moment he was gazing at a girl's
face framed in passion-flower and roses; and the
face was even fairer and more angelic than he had
imagined. Delicate, clear-cut features, eyes of
heavenly blue, a skin so pink and white that it
might almost have been painted, and the hair--the
glorious golden hair!</p>

<p class="indent">Afterwards he could never very clearly recall
what followed. He knew he was introduced to
&quot;Rafella&quot; as she stood at the window, that she
came in and apologised prettily for the mould that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page13" id="page13"></a>[pg&nbsp;13]</span>
stained her little hands--she said with engaging
simplicity that she had been digging potatoes.
He knew he was regaled with lemonade and water
biscuits, and that she sat and smiled, and looked
like a Madonna, while her father talked of missions
and asked innumerable questions concerning India.
Was the heat out there actually so severe? Was
there constant danger from snakes and wild beasts?
Was it true that the social life was demoralising
to the European? And how about the question
of drink, and the example set in that respect, and
others, by the English? Also, was it a fact that
the Oriental was possessed of strange faculties that
could not be explained, and had Captain Coventry
himself ever seen a man climb up a rope and vanish
into space?</p>

<p class="indent">All of which Captain Coventry answered to the
best of his capability, the whole while cogitating
how he might contrive his next meeting with the
vicar's daughter. At last a casual reference to
the coming sale of work presented an excellent
opportunity.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I wonder if I might bring my mother and my
sister to the show?&quot; he asked with diffidence.
&quot;They take such a keen interest in things of that
description.&quot; And he explained how easy it would
be to manage if he chartered a conveyance for the
afternoon.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page14" id="page14"></a>[pg&nbsp;14]</span>
Naturally the idea met with cordial encouragement,
and led to further interchange of personal
information. By the time Captain Coventry had
begun to feel that he could, with decency, remain
no longer, he was on most friendly terms with the
Reverend Mr. Forte and Rafella, the clergyman's
only child.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_II" id="CHAPTER_II"></a>CHAPTER II</h2>

<p class="h2a">IN THE GARDEN</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Until</span> the day of the sale of work at Under-edge
Vicarage Coventry lived through the hours as one
in a dream, dominated by the mental vision of a
gentle girl, by his ardent longing for the moment
when he should see her face again. He realised
that he had actually fallen in love at first sight,
admitted the fact to himself with grudging reluctance,
seeing that hitherto he had scoffed at belief
in such a possibility--like a person who suddenly
sees a ghost after contemptuous denial of the
supernatural.</p>

<p class="indent">He intended to make the girl his wife. She
might not be accomplished or clever; her education
must necessarily have been limited, reared, as she
had been, so apart from the world. Yet if she were
ignorant in the accepted sense of the word, she
must also be innocent, guileless, unacquainted with
evil--white and unsullied in thought and experience.
He had no desire for an intellectual wife;
in his opinion the more women knew the more
objectionable they became.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page16" id="page16"></a>[pg&nbsp;16]</span>
George Coventry was the kind of man who
could contemplate matrimony only under conditions
of supreme possession, mental as well as
physical. What his wife learnt of life he must
be the one to teach her; there must be no knowledge,
no memory in her heart of which he might
have reason to feel jealous in the most remote
degree. There was something of the Sultan in his
nature.</p>

<p class="indent">Perhaps he was not actively conscious of the
stringency of his attitude towards the female sex;
now, at least, he merely felt that he had &quot;struck&quot;
the very kind of girl he should care to marry,
and he harboured no manner of doubt in his mind
but that Rafella Forte was all she appeared and
all he conceived her to be--a sweet and simple
creature, his ideal of a bride.</p>

<p class="indent">His instinct was not wrong. The vicar's
daughter was a sweet and simple creature,
oblivious, if not wholly ignorant, of evil--and of
much besides. She made her own clothes, frequently
she cleaned her own and her father's boots;
she had driven in no vehicle more exalted than
the village fly, had ridden nothing better than a
donkey or a bicycle, had attended no entertainment
more exciting than a local tea party or a
penny reading. It was sinful, she thought, to
powder one's nose, or to wear shoes with high
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page17" id="page17"></a>[pg&nbsp;17]</span>
heels, or to cut one's hair in a fringe--then a
fashion that still was in favour. Her hats were
kept on with elastic, and she seldom looked long
at herself in the glass.</p>

<p class="indent">On the day of her sale, however, she looked
at her reflection in the mirror rather more attentively
than usual, just to make certain that her
hair was as tidy as troublesome curls and waves
would permit, that primrose soap and hot water
had effectively cleaned her face after her busy
morning, that her plain straw hat, bound by a
white ribbon, and her linen collar were straight.
She felt a trifle guilty because she desired to look
her best, an ambition that was somehow entangled,
quite unaccountably, with the prospect of meeting
Captain Coventry again. She had never met anyone
quite like Captain Coventry; he was so handsome
and he seemed to be so nice. She looked
forward with an odd and unwonted agitation to
his arrival. She hoped, though she was teased
by a slight suspicion to the contrary, that he was
a <i>good</i> man, that he was a teetotaller, and did not
smoke or play cards.</p>

<p class="indent">Then she went down into the garden, and became
too deeply engrossed in the arrangement of
her stall, and in consultations with early arrivals--the
doctor's wife and the wives of one or two
prominent farmers--as to the prices of their contributions,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page18" id="page18"></a>[pg&nbsp;18]</span>
and at what time tea ought to be ready,
and so forth, to concern herself further over his
possible vices. She also forgot to consider his
character when he drove up in a hired wagonette
with his mother, a gracious old lady in black silk
and a shawl, and his sister, a colourless person in
a dust cloak, who might have been equally thirty
or forty years of age. Rafella could think of
nothing at the moment but the disturbing expression
in Captain Coventry's eyes as he grasped her
hand in greeting, his strong, brown face, his crisp
moustache.</p>

<p class="indent">Further arrivals confused her, the schoolmaster
and his family, parties of villagers, contingents
from neighbouring parishes; she mixed up their
names, could not confine her attention to their
polite remarks; her usual calm self-assurance had
fled, everything seemed curiously changed and
unreal.</p>

<p class="indent">Coventry at once assumed the office of her chief
assistant, and proved himself a valuable salesman.
The women were attracted by his friendly manners
and his good looks, the men were interested in
his being a real soldier, in his having come from
India. They called him &quot;the Captain,&quot; and competed
to have converse with him, even if it should
entail the purchase of some useless article. His
high spirits infected the company, and his marked
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page19" id="page19"></a>[pg&nbsp;19]</span>
attentions to the vicar's daughter caused general
comment.</p>

<p class="indent">Rafella herself felt happy, extraordinarily
elated; his open admiration gave her an unaccustomed
sense of importance, and she was conscious
of the notice it aroused. Animated, flushed, she
looked a picture of exquisite maidenhood, in spite
of her plain and homely toilet. In Coventry's eyes
the virtuous simplicity of her attire only enhanced
her charm. He felt he should hate to behold her
in smart, up-to-date clothes.</p>

<p class="indent">The stall was soon cleared, and tea tickets
sold well--sixpence a head for the affluent in the
vicarage dining-room, twopence for the more
humble out in the garden at a long trestle table
in charge of the schoolmaster's wife. It was not
until most of the throng had departed that Coventry
found a chance of speaking with Rafella alone.
He ignored the timid remarks of his sister concerning
the time, her fears that &quot;mother might
feel fatigued or take cold if they remained too
late&quot;; and he calmly requested Miss Forte to
show him the kitchen garden.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;There is not much to see, I'm afraid,&quot; Rafella
said shyly, yet willing enough to take him.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;The very sight of an English kitchen garden
is refreshing to anyone from India,&quot; he informed
her; and they wandered off together, leaving
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page20" id="page20"></a>[pg&nbsp;20]</span>
Mr. Forte to entertain Mrs. Coventry and her
daughter and one or two lingering visitors in the
faded, old-fashioned drawing-room.</p>

<p class="indent">Truly there was little to see, beyond cabbages
and gooseberry bushes, and the cherished potato
patch, in the kitchen garden; the box borders had
grown high and thick, and sadly needed trimming.
There was an empty greenhouse, frequented by
toads, and in one corner stood a shaky summer-house,
suggestive of earwigs and spiders, dust and
cobwebs.</p>

<p class="indent">But to Coventry it was a garden of glamour and
dreams. For him a delicious enchantment hung
in the air, an infinite pleasure pervaded his being;
he wondered how long it must be before he might
dare to proclaim his passion, before he might hold
this dear girl in his arms as his promised wife.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;How would you like to go to India?&quot; he
asked her, dallying with the prospect of taking
her there, visualising her bright presence in his
bungalow.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;India! Oh, I don't know,&quot; she said, surprised.
&quot;I have never thought of going anywhere.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But--but you will marry some day,&quot; he suggested
tentatively, &quot;and then you will have to go
away.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">She blushed and laughed a little nervously.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, that is not at all likely; and even if it
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page21" id="page21"></a>[pg&nbsp;21]</span>
were, how could I leave my father? He has
become so dependent on me since my darling
mother's death.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">His spirits sank. He had forgotten all about
her father, and the filial sense of duty that would,
of course, prevail with such a dear, good girl. He
resigned himself to the prospect of struggle, opposition;
nevertheless, he meant to win, though in
the end the marriage might have to be delayed
for a reasonable period.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But your father would never stand in the way
of your happiness, surely?&quot; he argued.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I shouldn't be happy,&quot; she maintained, &quot;if I
thought I was behaving selfishly.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Of course, to a certain extent you are right,&quot;
he agreed; &quot;but, after all, there are limits to unselfishness.
Every woman has a just claim to her
own existence.&quot; (In the case of his sister this view
had not occurred to him.)</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Do you think so?&quot; she asked doubtfully, in
deference to his superior masculine wisdom.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes, I do. And if you look a little farther,
ought she to sacrifice the happiness of the man
who loves her, in addition to her own?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">She blushed again, more deeply, and glanced
away from him over the ragged garden steeped in
the languorous peace of a summer sunset. &quot;You
see&quot;--she hesitated--&quot;I know nothing about--love.&quot;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page22" id="page22"></a>[pg&nbsp;22]</span>
The word was spoken timidly, with modest
reluctance.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Sooner or later you are bound to learn its
meaning,&quot; he said, controlling his impulse to declare
that he would teach her. He recognised the
risk of precipitancy; she must not be alarmed. As
it was, she turned uneasily aside avoiding his
gaze; said they ought to go back, it was getting
late, Mrs. Coventry would be waiting for him;
nervously polite little sentences.</p>

<p class="indent">In silence he followed her along the path that
led to the door in the garden wall, noting the
grace of her slender form, the glint of the curls
that lay on her neck, the cream of the skin beneath
the curls.</p>

<p class="indent">When they arrived at the door he said
abruptly:</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I watched you go through here that morning.
You had no hat on, and you were singing
a hymn.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">He was trying to close the door that was
warped and stiff, so he missed the puzzled astonishment
in her eyes.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But how could you have seen me? It was
ever so long before you came to the house.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It was <i>why</i> I came to the house.&quot; He banged
the door impatiently and faced her. &quot;It was why
I came <i>back</i>,&quot; he added with emphasis.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page23" id="page23"></a>[pg&nbsp;23]</span>
Colour flooded Rafella's face; he thought how
adorably she blushed.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh,&quot; she gasped; &quot;but I thought it was because
of a stone in your horse's shoe. Didn't you
tell the truth?&quot; she questioned severely.</p>

<p class="indent">He laughed, delighting in her naive sense of
honesty. &quot;There was a stone all right, I can
assure you, and I blessed the excuse. All the
same, I should have come back on some pretext
or another. I could hardly have rung the front
door bell and said I had observed a young lady
with golden hair go through this door, and that
I wanted to see her again. Now, could I?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">She turned away, confused, agitated, utterly
unable to confront the tender banter in his eyes.
But he had not quite done. As they went into
the vicarage he asked boldly: &quot;Can I come again,
very soon, and talk to you in the garden?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Though she made no answer he did not feel
rebuffed.</p>

<hr class="hr2" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page24" id="page24"></a>[pg&nbsp;24]</span></p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_III" id="CHAPTER_III"></a>CHAPTER III</h2>

<p class="h2a">SUCCESS</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Some</span> three weeks later George Coventry proposed
to Rafella Forte, but not among the roses in the
sunshine, as he had so often pictured, for rain
was coming down with inconsiderate persistence.
The proposal took place in the church porch, where
they lingered after choir practice, hoping it might
clear.</p>

<p class="indent">His visits had been frequent since the day of
the sale; and once he had persuaded the vicar
and his daughter to spend an afternoon at his
mother's house, conveying them to and fro at his
own expense in the ever-available wagonette supplied
by the country town inn.</p>

<p class="indent">To-day he had arrived just as Rafella was about
to start for the church, enveloped in a macintosh,
holding a monstrous cotton umbrella over her
head; and for the last hour he had sat patiently
in a pew while school children droned out hymns
around Rafella and the harmonium, staring at
him throughout the performance with unblinking
curiosity.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page25" id="page25"></a>[pg&nbsp;25]</span>
Now the children had clattered away, Rafella
had closed the harmonium and put everything
straight, and they were alone in the porch; the
church door, covered with notices, was closed behind
them, and in front the rain streamed down
on the huddled graves, the sunken, lichen-stained
headstones, and the old-fashioned, coffin-shaped
tombs.</p>

<p class="indent">The supreme moment had come when, in spite
of the place and the weather, George Coventry
felt he could be silent no longer. There was little
doubt in his mind as to Rafella's feelings towards
himself, there could be no doubt in hers as to
his intentions; he had made them plain enough
almost from the first.</p>

<p class="indent">It was very soon over. He had spoken, he had
kissed her with passion yet reverence; she had
trembled, shed a few tears, confessed that she cared
for him. And then, as he had all along apprehended,
came the protest, when he urged a short
engagement, that she could not leave her father.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It would be wicked of me to leave him by
himself,&quot; she cried in tearful distress. &quot;He could
never get on without me. I think it would kill
him, and I should never forgive myself.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It would be wicked of <i>him</i> to want to keep
you always,&quot; said Coventry firmly. He was prepared,
within reason, to compromise, but he was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page26" id="page26"></a>[pg&nbsp;26]</span>
also determined not to be beaten. &quot;The moment
we get back to the vicarage I'll interview him in
his den. That was where you saw me first. Do
you remember, little angel saint? You looked
through the window, and I fell in love with your
darling face, as I had already fallen in love with
your hair and your voice. I say, couldn't we have
that hymn at our wedding?</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i4">&quot;<i>Other refuge have I none;</i></span>
<span class="i4"><i>Hangs my helpless soul on Thee.&quot;</i></span>
</div>
</div>

<p class="indent">He sang the words joyfully, quite out of tune,
for he was no musician.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, no. It wouldn't be suitable at all,&quot; she
said, rebuke in her voice.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I should say it was most appropriate, for I am
going to comfort and protect you as long as I live.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But it's not meant that way,&quot; she explained,
shocked. &quot;And, oh,&quot; she went on miserably, &quot;you
mustn't count on our being married. I feel
dreadful about it all. I don't know <i>what</i> father
would do without me. I can't think of going so
far away and leaving him alone. Don't ask him;
don't say anything about it.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Then, still standing in the porch, they went
over it all again. He argued, entreated, cajoled,
but her distress was so genuine, the conflict between
her love and her duty so acute, that at last
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page27" id="page27"></a>[pg&nbsp;27]</span>
Coventry found himself willing, almost, to agree
to an indefinite engagement, to the question of
marriage being deferred till his next return from
India. Finally he promised that if she would only
give him permission to speak to her father he
would press for no more than the vicar's consent
to a wedding perhaps two years hence.</p>

<p class="indent">They returned to the house through the rain,
Coventry rueful, depressed, yet alive to the virtue
of Rafella's decision--it was only in accordance
with the pure perfection of her character. He had
little hope of Mr. Forte being equally unselfish,
of his refusing to accept his daughter's temporary
sacrifice; two years to a man of his age would
seem a trifling period, and, of course, apart from
personal inconvenience, he would be all in favour
of discreet delay, and the wisdom of waiting, the
test of time on the affections, and so forth.
Coventry was conscious that were he in the vicar's
place, with a young and guileless daughter to consider,
his own sentiments would be identical;
therefore he ultimately sought his future father-in-law's
presence in a meek and dutifully acquiescent
spirit, not altogether free from nervousness.</p>

<p class="indent">The vicar's mouldy sanctum was not quite the
pleasant spot this afternoon that it had been on
the occasion of Coventry's first visit; now the room
was darkened by the rain, and the creepers, limp
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page28" id="page28"></a>[pg&nbsp;28]</span>
with moisture, clinging to the window. Mr. Forte
himself looked dismal and depressed; he complained
that the damp affected his throat and caused
discomfort in his joints. He indicated with a weary
gesture of his hand a pile of documents and ledgers
connected with parish affairs, and some blank
sheets of paper on which, owing to pressure of
other business, his sermon for to-morrow had not
yet been inscribed. He said he wished he could
afford a curate, though to Coventry's consternation
he affirmed that Rafella was as valuable to
him as any curate could be, save in the matter
of accounts and sermons.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;A good girl, Captain Coventry, a very good
girl!&quot; He shook his head as though he were
saddened rather than cheered by the fact of
Rafella's worth; but it was merely, as Coventry
understood, the vicar's manner of emphasising his
appreciation.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Indeed, sir, she has no equal!&quot; the younger
man agreed with fervour.</p>

<p class="indent">It seemed a rather inauspicious moment for
declaring his request, but delay could make no
difference, and he spoke out boldly, though with
quickened pulses, confessing that he had already
approached Rafella and had not been rejected. To
his amazed relief Mr. Forte listened to him with
benign attention.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page29" id="page29"></a>[pg&nbsp;29]</span>
&quot;I cannot pretend,&quot; he said, &quot;that I have been
altogether blind to your object in coming here,
but before we go any farther there are one or two
matters that must be discussed between us.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Coventry's heart went out to Rafella's father.
He felt sure that the vicar was suppressing his own
feelings in consideration of his cherished daughter's
happiness.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Dear old chap!&quot; he thought warmly. Readily
he said: &quot;Of course--my prospects and my
financial position, and my past? I hope I shall
be able to satisfy you on every point.&quot; And he
proceeded to explain that he possessed a fair income
of his own apart from his pay, an income that
must be materially increased on the death of his
mother. Therefore he could make adequate provision
for a wife and a possible family. There were
no secrets in his past or his present; he had led a
steady life, he was sound in health and, he hoped,
in morals. As for religion, he was a member of
the Church of England.</p>

<p class="indent">Then came a pause. Mr. Forte sat still, his
elbow on the table, his head resting on his hand.
He looked old and sad and tired, and George, with
compunction, remembered his promise to Rafella.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;If you will give your consent to an engagement,&quot;
he said impulsively, &quot;I would undertake
not to urge Rafella to marry me till I come back
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page30" id="page30"></a>[pg&nbsp;30]</span>
next time from India. I know she does not want
to leave you yet, and it would be wrong and selfish
of me to expect it.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The vicar placed his hand before his mouth
and coughed. To Coventry his self-possession
seemed extraordinary. The notion that worldly
inducements might weigh with this simple old
parson never came into his head.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well, well,&quot; said Mr. Forte magnanimously,
&quot;I must think it over. In the meantime, my dear
lad&quot;--with a smile of resignation he held out his
hand and Coventry grasped it emotionally--&quot;go
and talk to Rafella.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">He went, and a few minutes later the vicar
resumed his spectacles, drew the blank sheets of
sermon paper towards him, and opened his Bible.
He happened to light upon the text:</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i4">&quot;<i>Discretion shall preserve thee, understanding</i></span>
<span class="i4"><i>shall keep thee.&quot;</i></span>
</div>
</div>

<p class="indent">And he began to write rapidly.</p>

<p class="indent">Mr. Forte had made up his mind that Rafella
should marry Captain Coventry in the autumn
and go back with him to India. He would miss
his daughter sadly, the wrench of parting would
be cruel, but such things had to be; God would
give him grace to bear the trial.... Otherwise,
translated into the vulgar tongue--here was a
young man of good character and safe position,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page31" id="page31"></a>[pg&nbsp;31]</span>
with private means and clear prospects, who would
make an excellent husband; it was a chance in a
thousand, and if the fellow were ready and anxious
to marry the penniless daughter of a poverty-stricken
country clergyman, the vicar did not
intend to discourage him nor to take the hazard
of sentimental and unnecessary delays.</p>

<p class="indent">His decision was imparted (in the more dignified
form) a couple of hours later to the expectant pair,
whom he discovered seated close together on the
springless sofa in the drawing-room, and there
followed an affecting little scene. Tears, embraces,
hand-shakes, blessings, assurances, general happy
excitement, tinged for father and daughter with
natural and touching melancholy.</p>

<p class="indent">When it was all over and the vicar had returned
to his study, Coventry drew a long breath. The
day for him had been one of unaccustomed
emotional strain, and he felt a wholesome craving
for refreshment.</p>

<p class="indent">Almost involuntarily he said: &quot;I'd give anything
for a peg!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;A peg?&quot; echoed Rafella, mystified.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Meaning a whisky and soda.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, George!&quot; She held primitive principles
with regard to strong drink, though already she
was reconciled to the fact that he smoked innumerable
cigarettes.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page32" id="page32"></a>[pg&nbsp;32]</span>
&quot;Is it so shocking?&quot; he asked, with an indulgent
smile.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well,&quot; she said uneasily, &quot;you see, we think
temperance so important. Beer I can understand,
in strict moderation, though I don't approve of
it; we always keep a small cask in the cupboard
under the stairs in case it should be wanted, and,
of course, there is a little brandy in my medicine
chest; we use it, too, for moistening the jam
papers. But we haven't any <i>whisky</i>!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">He perceived that the imbibing of spirits as
an ordinary drink might appear to his fiancée as
little less than wicked. Concealing his amusement,
he explained, as a personal precaution, that though,
of course, it was revolting to see a lady consume
alcohol, unless by the doctor's orders, it was, taken
judiciously, harmless, if not beneficial, to men,
particularly to men accustomed to a hot climate;
thus allaying her scruples and fears on his own
behalf. He accepted a large cup of tea in preference
to beer from the cupboard under the
stairs, or brandy from the medicine chest, both
of which Rafella proffered hospitably after his
reassurance.</p>

<p class="indent">The wedding took place a fortnight before
Coventry was to sail for India. One or two trivial
disputes arose between the affianced pair, and on
each occasion George's will prevailed. For example
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page33" id="page33"></a>[pg&nbsp;33]</span>
over the trousseau. It appeared that Rafella
was entitled, on her twenty-first birthday, or on
her marriage, to the legacy of a hundred pounds
bequeathed to her by her godmother. She maintained
that the half of this sum would be ample
for her outfit, and she was on the point of engaging
the village dressmaker to work daily at
the vicarage, when George interfered. Though he
did not wish Rafella to be anything but simply
dressed, he had a suspicion that Under-edge
fashions might be regarded as somewhat peculiar
in an Indian military station. Therefore he insisted
that her &quot;costumes,&quot; as she called them,
should at least be ordered in the little country
town, under the guidance of his mother and sister,
in whose taste he had implicit confidence. The
result enchanted all concerned, though certainly
it might have evoked contempt on the part of the
more fastidious.</p>

<p class="indent">At any rate, in Coventry's eyes, and in the
opinion of all present at the wedding, Rafella
looked lovely as a bride; and, indeed, it was a very
pretty ceremony, altogether, in its idyllic simplicity.
The autumn day was radiant with sunshine, the
kind of day when spiders' webs hang sparkling
and perfect, as though spun with tiny crystal beads,
and the air is still and humid; when the foliage,
all red and gold, strikes wonder, and the blackberries
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page34" id="page34"></a>[pg&nbsp;34]</span>
are ripe and round and purple. The little
church was decked with brilliant leaves and berries,
and the pews were as well filled as if it had been
Christmas Day. Not that any formal invitations
had been issued; the only wedding guests from
any distance were the bridegroom's near relations
(he had few besides), and the bride's only aunt,
who had consented to come and live at the vicarage
and to join her small income to that of her brother.
But the entire village was present in Sunday garments,
save those who were bedridden and had
been left without compunction to take care of themselves
for the time. Rafella's only aunt did successful
battle with the unwilling harmonium, and
with much solemn emotion the vicar married his
daughter to Captain Coventry.</p>

<p class="indent">It may be added that the bridegroom also had
his way, after all, about the hymn, and it was sung
by the congregation with a raucous fervour that
stirred George Coventry to the depths of his being,
for he could not help investing the words with a
personal application, in spite of Rafella's previous
protests to the contrary.</p>

<p class="indent">So the newly married pair sailed a fortnight
later for India; and the unsophisticated daughter
of an obscure country parson found herself
launched without preparation into a world that to
her was completely bewildering. From the stagnation
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page35" id="page35"></a>[pg&nbsp;35]</span>
of English village existence, and from
relative hardship, she went straight into the activities,
contradictions, and comparative luxuries of
life in a large Indian station, a life that, perhaps,
has no actual parallel anywhere else on earth.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page36" id="page36"></a>[pg&nbsp;36]</span></p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IV" id="CHAPTER_IV"></a>CHAPTER IV</h2>

<p class="h2a">MRS. GREAVES</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Greaves</span> stood on the platform of one of the
largest railway stations in Upper India. The lights
flashed down upon a pushing, shouting throng of
dark-faced, turbaned humanity, for it was eight
o'clock at night, and the mail train for Bombay
was due to start in another few minutes. The
chill, cold-weather mist of evening, creeping into
the vast echoing station, seemed to compress the
curious odours inseparable from an Eastern crowd--the
sour exhalations, the commingling of spices
and perfumes and garlic--and to prevent them
from dispersing.</p>

<p class="indent">A little group of English people stood outside
the door of a first-class compartment, a saloon-shaped
compartment that to those unaccustomed to
travel in the East would perhaps have seemed
luxurious; but in a country where journeys may
last for days and nights on end a certain degree
of comfort becomes a necessity. Mrs. Greaves had
come to the station to see Mrs. Munro, her friend,
and little Trixie Munro, her godchild, off to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page37" id="page37"></a>[pg&nbsp;37]</span>
England; also, incidentally, to take the bereft husband
back to her bungalow for dinner with herself
and Captain Greaves. It would be cruel, she felt,
to permit the poor man to return to a lonely meal
in the house that would still breathe of the presence
of wife and child.</p>

<p class="indent">Within the compartment bedding had been laid
out along the seats, luggage was heaped at one
end--the loose, miscellaneous luggage of the
Anglo-Indian traveller, brown canvas hold-alls,
and clothes bags, sun hats, a tiffin basket, a water-bottle
in a leather-case, and a lidless packing-case
filled with odds and ends that might be needed on
the journey down country. An ayah, enveloped in
a scarlet shawl, was endeavouring to pacify the
child, who, beside herself with excitement, was
jumping up and down, and ordering her parents
in shrill Hindustani to make haste and come inside
the carriage, else they would assuredly be left
behind. She had not understood as yet that
Dadda must be left behind in any case.</p>

<p class="indent">At three years old little Trixie Munro was a
beautiful baby, perfectly shaped, with masses of
bright, curling hair, and luminous eyes; she was
full of vitality, restless and gay as a sprite. Mrs.
Greaves had always declared that Trixie looked as
though she ought to be riding, naked, on a butterfly,
with a little red cap on her head. She formed a striking
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page38" id="page38"></a>[pg&nbsp;38]</span>
contrast to her mother who, pale and tearful,
almost in a condition of collapse, was nerving herself
with trembling effort for her first parting from
her husband, though she hoped he was to follow
her on leave in six months' time. It is a very
common scene in India, such partings on platforms
or on steamer decks. Domestic separation is only
a part of the price that is paid for service in the
country, but it is a part that is by no means easy
to bear, even when faced with submission and
courage.</p>

<p class="indent">Mrs. Greaves's pleasant, freckled face was
sad. She had been through such family partings
herself, her own two robust little boys were at
home, dedicated in the future to the Army and the
Navy, and she sympathised with the husband and
wife, neither of whom was very stout-hearted.
Ellen Munro was her most intimate friend; it was
a curious kind of friendship, based chiefly upon
the fact that the two were old schoolfellows, and
also distant connections. This had drawn them
more closely together when they found themselves
in the same station. But in character, as well
as in looks, they were different--Marion Greaves
being a sound and sensible little English memsahib,
full of energy and common sense, with
curling chestnut hair and a freckled skin that had
earned her the good-natured nickname in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page39" id="page39"></a>[pg&nbsp;39]</span>
station of &quot;The Plover's Egg.&quot; She loved riding
and tennis and dancing, was fearless and direct.
Whereas Ellen Munro was one of those helpless,
incapable beings who seem to invite misfortune,
and to accept it without a struggle. Her appearance
was limp, her nature humble, affectionate,
apologetic, and she clung with pathetic devotion
to Marion Greaves, the staunchest of friends, who
felt for her that species of protective fondness so
often accorded to the weak by the strong. As for
Mr. Munro, he was a delicate, clever young man,
who would have been better at home in a Government
office than leading the strenuous life of an
Indian civilian. He could not handle a gun, he
was never happy in the saddle, physically he soon
tired, though his office work could not be beaten.</p>

<p class="indent">Mrs. Greaves frequently marvelled in secret
how such a child as Trixie had ever been born of
such parents--Trixie so vigorous, daring, self-willed,
giving promise of a passionate, generous
nature. She admired and loved her small goddaughter,
and her affection for Ellen Munro,
though tinged with contempt, was warm and
sincere. Therefore she felt this good-bye acutely.</p>

<p class="indent">A sudden calm came over the hitherto noisy
platform; passengers had at last been safely packed
into the train, and arrivals had finally pushed and
yelled themselves out of the station. One or two
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page40" id="page40"></a>[pg&nbsp;40]</span>
fruit and sweetmeat sellers, and a water-carrier,
still wandered up and down with droning cries;
and now the Munros got into the compartment
together for a last embrace. Mrs. Greaves attracted
Trixie to the window by holding up a toy she had
brought with her for the purpose--that the child
should not interrupt the parting. And while
Trixie was laughing and chattering, and grabbing
at her godmother's gift, her father kissed her
swiftly; then, stepping white and silent from the
carriage, he shut the door, and the train moved
out of the station.</p>

<hr />

<p class="indent">It was very soon after Mrs. Munro had sailed
for England that Rafella Coventry arrived in the
station as a bride.</p>

<p class="indent">Mrs. Greaves saw her for the first time one
afternoon seated a little apart, looking rather forlorn,
watching her husband play tennis in the
public gardens. The turf was emerald green, the
blue, far-away sky was just flecked with some little
white clouds that foretold the showers of winter;
the air was crisp and exhilarating, and everyone
save Mrs. Coventry was either playing a game, or
awaiting their turns for tennis and badminton
courts.</p>

<p class="indent">Rafella was suffering from a cold in her head,
and her nose and eyes were inflamed. Deluded
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page41" id="page41"></a>[pg&nbsp;41]</span>
by the perpetual sunshine she had worn summer
garments to start with, ignoring her husband's
advice to the contrary; but now she sat wrapped in
a cape that, though useful and warm, was unbecoming
both in colour and style. She felt shy and
depressed, and antagonistic towards this concourse
of people, who all seemed to know one another so
well--who belonged to a world that was completely
outside her experience.</p>

<p class="indent">Mrs. Greaves asked who she was; and a malapert
subaltern told her.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;That's the bride, Captain Coventry's new
acquisition. Just the sort of raw rustic he would
have chosen, with his peculiar ideas of what a
woman should be. They say he discovered her in
some prehistoric hamlet at home, and that she'd
never seen a man till she met him, or a train till
she started on her honeymoon. She looks like it.
No fear of <i>her</i> kicking over the traces.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You never know,&quot; laughed Mrs. Greaves.
&quot;And if you can forget her cape and her hat, and
her obvious cold, you will observe that she is
remarkably pretty, so you'd better reserve your
judgment.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">She had noted the beauty of the girl's eyes and
complexion despite their present afflicted condition,
and she guessed at the wealth of hair concealed by
the unfashionable hat.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page42" id="page42"></a>[pg&nbsp;42]</span>
&quot;An angel in asses' clothing--no, that's not
quite right. What is the text exactly?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh! go and miss balls at tennis, and don't
talk nonsense,&quot; advised Mrs. Greaves.</p>

<p class="indent">The woebegone appearance of the little bride
had aroused her kind-hearted compassion. She
approached Rafella, though they had not been
introduced, and seated herself in a basket-chair at
her side.</p>

<p class="indent">She began the acquaintance with the usual
remarks and queries that greet all the newly arrived
in India. Mrs. Coventry had never been out here
before? What did she think of the country, of
an Indian station? How did she like the life?
What an extraordinary contrast it seemed at first,
and so on.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I remember so well,&quot; Mrs. Greaves chattered
on in tactful sympathy, &quot;how strange I found
everything when I came out as a bride, though I
was born in India and didn't go home until I was
five. I made the most awful mistakes, and I
thought I should never pick up Hindustani! I
always said exactly the opposite to what I intended--like
'Come here' when I meant 'Go away'--which
was so awkward if I happened to be in my
bath!--and all that kind of thing.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Rafella's suspicions and shyness succumbed to
these friendly advances. She confided to Mrs.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page43" id="page43"></a>[pg&nbsp;43]</span>
Greaves that she was afraid she should find housekeeping
dreadfully difficult--she had not been
accustomed at home to an army of servants, nor
to a lady's maid (as she called her ayah), nor to
a carriage, nor to more than two courses at meals.
It all seemed to her to savour of wicked display
and extravagance; and as far as she could judge
at present, people in India appeared to live for
nothing but amusement and self-indulgence.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But you must remember,&quot; admonished Mrs.
Greaves, &quot;that we are living under totally different
conditions out here. The servants won't do each
other's work, on account of their caste. We have
to keep such a lot, not for our own convenience
but for theirs. And you must have an ayah, unless
you don't mind the menservants attending to your
bedroom.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Rafella flushed uncomfortably. This last
remark struck her as rather indelicate.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Then as to the food,&quot; went on Mrs. Greaves,
ignorant of having offended the taste of her hearer.
&quot;Materials are a good deal cheaper out here than
they are at home, and not nearly so nourishing,
so that extra courses in a climate like this are not
so extravagant as they might seem. It is better
to give the servants plenty to do, and to keep
them up to a certain standard, since we have to
respect their prejudices; and there is also custom
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page44" id="page44"></a>[pg&nbsp;44]</span>
and prestige to be considered, which are not to
be slighted in this country. That you will soon
find out! If you were to reduce your establishment
and your meals, and your general manner
of living in your position, you'd never get a respectable
servant to stay with you, and your name
would be a byword in the bazaar!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">There was a pause. Rafella said nothing, and
Mrs. Greaves felt she had come up against a
narrow and obstinate nature. Nevertheless, she
continued her well-meant harangue.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;As to amusements, what else have we to fall
back upon but each other's society? We are all
cut off from home and our relations and intellectual
advantages; and wholesome exercise, whether
tennis, riding, dancing, or sport, cannot be classed
as self-indulgence when it is well within our reach
financially. The men work hard for the greater
part of the day--perhaps you have not yet realised
how much your husband gets through before he
is free to follow the recreations that suit him best?
You mustn't judge Indian life too quickly from
the surface, or from your own standpoint.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I wish to do good,&quot; said Rafella priggishly,
&quot;and it seems to me that I have no one to be kind
to but the ayah.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Don't worry about that!&quot; advised Mrs.
Greaves, suppressing a smile. &quot;There's plenty of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page45" id="page45"></a>[pg&nbsp;45]</span>
time. You'll find you'll have as much as you can
do for the next few months getting used to India,
and, if I may make a suggestion, don't be <i>too</i>
kind to the ayah, or she'll think you're afraid
of her and take every advantage. What native
servants appreciate is justice and patience, not
indulgence, which they always mistake for weakness.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;She certainly has asked for a great many
things,&quot; Rafella confessed, &quot;but she seems so poor,
and says she has such a large family, that I gave
her more wages and some clothes, and a very nice
lantern and a couple of warm blankets, and I have
promised her an allowance of sugar and tea and
the money to buy a goat.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well, I hope you won't regret it,&quot; remarked
Mrs. Greaves.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Have you ever regretted doing what you
could for other people?&quot; There was lofty reproach
in Mrs. Coventry's voice.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Often!&quot; replied Mrs. Greaves, unashamed.

Despite this admission, she did all she could
for Mrs. Coventry during the next few weeks,
having regard to the bride's youth and inexperience,
for the colonel of Captain Coventry's regiment
was a bachelor, and just then, as it happened,
there were no other ladies with the battalion. She
was rather missing Ellen Munro, and was glad
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page46" id="page46"></a>[pg&nbsp;46]</span>
to transfer her support and counsel to Rafella
Coventry, imparting to her all she knew herself
concerning household management in India and
Anglo-Indian rules and customs. All about calling
and precedence, and dusters and charcoal, and
stores and prices, including the error of supposing
that a memsahib need never go near her kitchen,
or bother about the milk and the water, and pots
and pans, &quot;for,&quot; she cautioned her pupil, &quot;that
way typhoid lies!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Thus she came to know Mrs. Coventry rather
well, though at the bottom of her heart she was
reluctantly aware that she would never grow really
attached to this Madonna-faced young woman who
so prided herself on her conscience, and was so
severe on the failings of others. She was called
&quot;sweet little Mrs. Coventry&quot; by the station when
her cold had subsided, for her beauty, combined
with her puritanical notions, formed a novel
attraction. As time went on she learnt to ride,
and play tennis after a fashion, also to dance quite
nicely, in order, as she carefully explained, to
please her husband; but as George Coventry did
not dance, and openly preferred racquets to tennis,
and pig-sticking and polo to aimless rides, the
excuse seemed a trifle superfluous. At the same
time, everyone agreed that however indifferently
she might ride or play tennis, her husband
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page47" id="page47"></a>[pg&nbsp;47]</span>
ought more often to share with her both forms
of exercise.</p>

<p class="indent">These active accomplishments were taught her
for the most part by admiring subalterns, who
raved of her hair and her eyes and her seraphic
disposition. Later, Mrs. Greaves was amused to
observe that Rafella was making efforts to arrange
her hair in the latest fashion. Her hair, she told
Mrs. Greaves, was coming out in handfuls, and
she thought a change for a time might prove beneficial.
Then the mud-coloured dresses and high
evening gowns were gradually discarded, to be
replaced by white linens and serges, and simple
though elegant frocks for dinners and dances.
Also, there came a gradual moderation in Mrs.
Coventry's opinions, a setting aside of small
scruples, significant signs of a self-confident conceit
that was fostered by the opportunities and circumstances
inseparable from a mode of life in direct
opposition to the one in which she had been reared.
The ayah found herself neglected; Rafella had
discovered a pleasanter method of doing good to
others, that of bestowing good advice on erring
young men, inviting their confidences, using her
pure and virtuous influence--deluding herself and
the susceptible youths with the notion that she was
their mother-confessor and friend, their safeguard
against the wicked temptations and wiles of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page48" id="page48"></a>[pg&nbsp;48]</span>
world. In short, though with the most innocent
motives, &quot;sweet little Mrs. Coventry&quot; got herself
talked about, for these secrets entailed prolonged
consultations, seclusion in corners apart from the
crowd, notes, and mysterious appointments.</p>

<p class="indent">At first Captain Coventry laughed and paid
little attention. Rafella kept nothing from him.
He heard the whole history of Mr. Ricardo's engagement,
that was such a mistake, to a girl he
had ceased to care for at home. He knew all about
Dickie Macpherson's dreadful entanglement, that
he now so bitterly repented, with an unscrupulous
woman; and he pretended to listen to all that
Rafella had preached to young Grey so successfully
on the subject of cards and champagne.</p>

<p class="indent">Mrs. Greaves wondered how long it would be
before he awoke to the fact that his wife was indulging
in pious flirtations that were regarded by
the station with good-natured amusement.</p>

<p class="indent">One afternoon she was astonished to meet
Rafella riding demurely along the Mall with Mr.
Kennard. The man was a barrister, handsome,
successful, in the prime of his maturity, but his
moral reputation was anything but good. If
Rafella had schemes for reforming this gentleman,
serious trouble would certainly follow. George
Coventry was hardly the man to look on and laugh
at a dangerous friendship; Rafella's little team of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page49" id="page49"></a>[pg&nbsp;49]</span>
harmless young men was a different matter altogether.</p>

<p class="indent">Mrs. Greaves's expression as she returned their
salutations must have betrayed her surprised apprehension,
for Rafella flushed as she nodded, and
Mr. Kennard smiled with sardonic understanding.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Evidently that woman thinks I'm not a fit
companion for you,&quot; he said to Rafella as they
rode on beneath the trees. &quot;She's always had her
knife into me, though she poses as a model of
charity and soft-heartedness. What a pity it is
when lemon juice is blended with the milk of
human kindness! I don't know why she should
try to do me harm, unless it's because I have never
gone out of my way to propitiate her; but, then,&quot;
he added with flattering emphasis, &quot;there are very
few women I care to make friends with.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Rafella felt that this was not what she should
have expected of Mrs. Greaves. It only showed
how mistaken one might be in one's estimate of
other people's natures. She answered sympathetically:</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;How narrow-minded of her. I shouldn't pay
any attention to what she thought or said.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I don't,&quot; he assured her; &quot;and may I say
that I hope you won't either?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">He reined his horse a little closer to Rafella's
and looked into her eyes with subtle appeal.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page50" id="page50"></a>[pg&nbsp;50]</span>
&quot;Of course I shouldn't,&quot; she said, returning
his gaze with innocent encouragement. &quot;I always
take people as I find them, and I never listen to
gossip.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">He just touched her arm with his own in grateful
appreciation. &quot;That's a relief to my mind,&quot;
he told her. &quot;You don't know how hard it is to
live down indiscretions, even when they may not
have been all one's own fault. Some day, if you
will let me, I should like to tell you a lot about
myself, though there is no reason why I should
bother you with my affairs.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Rafella's heart went out to him. All the little
confidences of her boy admirers seemed trivial in
comparison with the unfortunate experiences of this
man of the world. She was well aware that he
was ill-spoken of by the more scrupulous members
of the community; but she felt convinced he was
misjudged, and even if there should be truth in
such reports as she had heard, surely sympathy
and kindness from a woman who was good was all
he needed to enable him to make amends for everything,
however regrettable, that might have happened
in the past.</p>

<p class="indent">It was only during the last ten days that Mr.
Kennard had sought Mrs. Coventry's company.
As a rule he consorted chiefly with the &quot;smarter&quot;
portion of society in the station, the English
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page51" id="page51"></a>[pg&nbsp;51]</span>
cavalry regiment, and a few pretentious people
with private incomes, who affected to order their
households on lines that were more or less English,
and to despise what they called &quot;country ways.&quot;
Sometimes the result of such pretension was
ludicrous, but, on the whole, the humble outsider
was deeply impressed, while the envious raged and
scorned. Such a clique concerned themselves
little with anyone's morals, provided their guests
were as exclusive as themselves and could
afford to return their festivities. It was a
feeble reflection of a second-rate section of London
society.</p>

<p class="indent">Mr. Kennard began his campaign by calling
on Mrs. Coventry, without, however, the smallest
apology for never having done so before, though
the Coventrys lived in the bungalow next to his
own. It must be confessed that Rafella, instead
of receiving him coldly, or not receiving him at
all, felt gratified rather than ruffled by this belated
attention, though she condemned the circle in
which he moved.</p>

<p class="indent">She told George of the visit with ill-concealed
triumph. She knew there were several women
who were anxious for Mr. Kennard to call on
them, who even had lowered themselves so far as
to send him invitations to dinner, which for the
most part he did not trouble to answer. Rafella
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page52" id="page52"></a>[pg&nbsp;52]</span>
felt she had scored. But George did not share
her elation.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;That fellow!&quot; he said contemptuously.
&quot;What infernal cheek. Don't let him hang about
this house, that's all.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But, surely,&quot; argued Rafella in gentle reproach,
&quot;it would be better for him to come here
if it takes him away from the frivolous people
he mixes with now?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Birds of a feather,&quot; said George. &quot;He's a
beast, and I hate him.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">George seemed in such a bad temper to-day
that she considered it wiser at present to withhold
the information that she had told Mr. Kennard he
might come in and see her whenever he liked.
Sometimes George was so hard and intolerant.
She wished he was rather more Christian in his
ideas. She made up her mind that if Mr. Kennard
could be weaned from his bad companions it was
her duty to undertake such a good work, and
George would be wrong to hinder her efforts.</p>

<p class="indent">Mr. Kennard very soon came again, and she
felt rather relieved that he should have chosen a
time when George was absent on duty. They
strolled round the garden and talked of things
in the abstract. Rafella was gracious and kind,
and looked sweet in her soft white gown and flower-trimmed
hat. Mr. Kennard was delightful, she
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page53" id="page53"></a>[pg&nbsp;53]</span>
thought. His manner was so courteous and charming,
and he listened with such deferential respect
to anything she had to say. Evidently he felt it
a privilege to be in her company. Once or twice
he just touched on his loneliness as a bachelor,
which drove him, he hinted, to seek undesirable
distractions--distractions of which, in his heart,
he was weary and sometimes ashamed. It was all
very subtly conveyed, and Rafella felt more than
ever convinced that he needed most sorely the
friendship and help of a high-minded woman, and
that she was the woman to provide what was
wanted. He must have been &quot;guided&quot; to come
to her, and she prayed for him hard that night.</p>

<p class="indent">The visits continued. Sometimes she mentioned
to George that Mr. Kennard had looked
in to lend her a book, or to leave her a bunch of
his violets--he was famous for his violets, that
bloomed in pots three deep in his veranda. More
often she held her tongue; not that she had any
feeling of guilt in the matter, but because George
was unreasonable about Mr. Kennard. He had
taken to sulking whenever he saw the man at her
side in the club or in the gardens, and was cross
if she danced with him more often than once, or
if he joined her out riding.</p>

<p class="indent">She was perfectly aware that George did not
suspect her of anything wrong; it was Mr. Kennard
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page54" id="page54"></a>[pg&nbsp;54]</span>
he suspected; and on one occasion, when
he had been almost violent because Mr. Kennard
had given her a dog, she spoke her mind, calmly,
persuasively, pointing out that Mr. Kennard
always behaved like a gentleman, that George was
not treating her fairly by making such scenes, and
that he could not know how deeply her feelings
were hurt.</p>

<p class="indent">Then she broke down and cried like a child
that is punished unjustly; and George took her
in his arms and kissed her, trying to feel that
he had been a brute, knowing all the time that his
instinct was correct, that Kennard was not the
right man for his wife to befriend.</p>

<hr class="hr2" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page55" id="page55"></a>[pg&nbsp;55]</span></p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_V" id="CHAPTER_V"></a>CHAPTER V</h2>

<p class="h2a">THE LIE</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rafella</span> took rather unfair advantage of George's
repentance, undoubtedly half-hearted though it
was. She asked him, as she forgave him, if he
would not try to be generous, and allow her to
invite Mr. Kennard to dinner, only to show that
he realised the unreasonableness of his attitude?
And with her golden head on his shoulder, and her
soft lips close to his own, Coventry consented.</p>

<p class="indent">As might have been expected the experiment
was not a success. Even before dinner was over
Rafella perceived her mistake. She had hoped so
much from the evening--hoped that her husband
and Mr. Kennard would make friends, that in
future all would be pleasant and smooth.</p>

<p class="indent">Instead of which George broke his promise,
and behaved like a bear. He was a man who could
not conceal his aversions, and seldom attempted
to do so; and the mere sight of Mr. Kennard at
his table, sleek and urbane, and indifferent to his
dislike, incensed him and rendered him glum and
ungracious. He talked, when he talked at all,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page56" id="page56"></a>[pg&nbsp;56]</span>
only to Mrs. Greaves, who, with her husband and
Mr. Munro, made up the party of six. Mrs.
Greaves saw with foreboding the look in George
Coventry's eyes as he watched his wife and Mr.
Kennard conversing with intimate ease, and she
felt as if they were eating their dinner with an
explosive beneath the table. How she wished
Rafella were not such a self-confident fool! Since
the day on which she had met the pair riding
together Rafella had carefully avoided being alone
with her; she hoped when they repaired to the
drawing-room that she might have a chance of
introducing a word of advice, but whether by intention
or otherwise the <i>tête-à-tête</i> was evaded;
coffee was served in the dining-room, and later
they all left the table together.</p>

<p class="indent">Mrs. Coventry preserved a semblance of good
spirits during the uncomfortable hour that followed.
She warbled a few English ballads while
her husband scowled in a corner and Mr. Kennard
turned over the songs for his hostess. He alone
of the company appeared quite unaffected by the
strain in the atmosphere.</p>

<p class="indent">Mrs. Greaves rose early to go, and Mr. Munro
escaped simultaneously. As they drove out of the
compound, Mrs. Greaves said to her husband:</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What an appalling evening! I can't think
how Rafella persuaded her husband to let her invite
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page57" id="page57"></a>[pg&nbsp;57]</span>
that odious man. Evidently he did it under protest.
I only hope he didn't look back into the
drawing-room when he was seeing us off.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Mrs. Greaves, looking back, had observed Mr.
Kennard bending over Rafella at the piano, obviously
uttering words that caused her to lower her
head in self-conscious confusion.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I'm certain,&quot; Mrs. Greaves added, &quot;he was
taking the opportunity when our backs were turned
of saying something he shouldn't.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well, it's no business of ours,&quot; said Captain
Greaves, with masculine unconcern. &quot;Kennard's
a rascal, and the woman's an ass, as I've always
told you; and if Coventry can't manage his wife
it's his own fault. Anyway, you can do nothing
to stop it, so you'd better not interfere.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But I shall interfere,&quot; said his wife. &quot;I can't
see Rafella wrecking her happiness, and not say
a word.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Captain Greaves only shrugged his shoulders
and urged the pony along.</p>

<p class="indent">What Mr. Kennard had been saying to Rafella,
when her husband had left the room, was this:</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I'm afraid I did wrong to come. I hope it
won't mean a bad time for you afterwards?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I--I hoped it would have been all right,&quot;
Rafella faltered, gazing down at the keys of the
piano.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page58" id="page58"></a>[pg&nbsp;58]</span>
He sighed. &quot;Give a dog a bad name,&quot; he
quoted despairingly. &quot;In future I suppose I'd
better keep away. It would be wiser for your
sake. I'd do anything to save you bother and
prevent misunderstandings. I should be the only
one to suffer, and I dare say I deserve it.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, I am so sorry! I can't tell you how
sorry and ashamed I feel.&quot; Her eyes were full of
tears as she raised them to his for a moment.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You know you've only to tell me what you
want me to do, and I'll do it, Rafella.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Hush!&quot; she said tremulously. &quot;If you talk
like that, I shall be obliged to tell you to keep
away.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Would you miss me--would you mind if you
never saw me again?&quot; Before she could answer,
he raised his voice. &quot;And so you see there was
nothing else to be done,&quot; he said cheerfully, for
Coventry had re-entered the room.</p>

<p class="indent">Mr. Kennard accepted a drink offered with
curtness by his host, and then he went back to his
bungalow.</p>

<p class="indent">Rafella tidied her music in offended silence.
She felt very angry with George. He had behaved
so rudely and spoilt the evening, and she meant
him to feel her displeasure. George also was
silent, provokingly silent; he smoked a cigarette
and drank a whisky and soda, and did not appear
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page59" id="page59"></a>[pg&nbsp;59]</span>
to be conscious of her annoyance. At last she
threw down a volume of songs with a bang on the
piano, and burst into tears. To her astonished
resentment George took no notice. It was the first
time since their marriage that her tears had not
melted his heart. In a passion of mortification she
rushed from the room. With her usual self-righteous
consideration she never exacted her
ayah's attendance the last thing at night, so there
was no need to check her distress in her bedroom.
Still crying she quickly undressed and got into
bed, and then she lay waiting for George to come
in and say he was sorry, to own himself in the
wrong.</p>

<p class="indent">She could hear him moving about in his dressing-room.
Several times she was tempted to call
him, but pride held her dumb, so convinced did
she feel that he owed her amends for his conduct,
that the first advances should come from him. But
she waited in vain. George remained in his room;
and Rafella, exhausted with tears and emotion,
finally fell asleep.</p>

<p class="indent">When she awoke in the morning, later than
usual, she was told that the sahib had gone forth
at daybreak to shoot, and had left her a message
to say that he should not return till the evening.
Often when George had arranged to take a day's
shooting, he slept in his dressing-room so that he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page60" id="page60"></a>[pg&nbsp;60]</span>
should not disturb Rafella by rising at dawn, and
it was rather a relief to feel that the present occasion
would give rise to no comment among the
servants. She remembered that to-night he was
dining at mess, and she determined rancorously
that she would not be in to receive him when he
came home to dress.</p>

<p class="indent">Before she was out of her room a note and a
book and a posy of violets came from Mr. Kennard.
She replied to the note with a smile of
bitter complacency curving her lips.</p>

<hr />

<p class="indent">That evening Mrs. Greaves turned over the
pages of a fashion paper in a corner of the club.
It was previous to the days when &quot;going to the
club&quot; had ceased to be a popular proceeding; it
was not yet considered more civilised to go home
with a few particular friends for the interval before
dinner. The ladies' room was filled with groups
of people refreshing themselves with tea after
healthy exercise afoot or on horseback, or on the
river, and the lofty building resounded with voices
and laughter. The hot weather was within
measurable distance, but the days were still
pleasant, and the general exodus to the hills had
not begun. The tennis courts in the public gardens
were crowded every evening, the bandstand well
surrounded, the Mall lively with riders and drivers;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page61" id="page61"></a>[pg&nbsp;61]</span>
and the last ball of the season had yet to take
place.</p>

<p class="indent">Mrs. Greaves had played four sets of tennis,
and now she was waiting for her husband to join
her from the polo ground.</p>

<p class="indent">Two women seated themselves at a tea-table
just in front of her, and though she was absorbed
in making up her mind whether to send home for
one of the seductive blouses sketched on the advertisement
page of the paper, she heard, unavoidably,
scraps of their talk. First they discussed
the ball that the bachelors of the station were
giving next night in return for hospitality extended
to them throughout the cold weather by the
married members of the community. It was, they
believed, to be an exceptionally brilliant affair;
the supper was to include pomfrets from Bombay,
and confections from Peliti's--the Buszard of
India. From this they went on to the subject of
their gowns for the ball.</p>

<p class="indent">Then one of them said: &quot;Look! There's Mrs.
Coventry, and, needless to say, Mr. Kennard.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The other looked up sharply; so did Mrs.
Greaves, and this was the conversation that reached
her unwilling ears.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Did you ever see such a change in anyone?
You weren't here when she came out as a bride?
No, of course, I remember, you were at home.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page62" id="page62"></a>[pg&nbsp;62]</span>
I assure you she looked like a Salvation Army
lass, or a charity school girl, her hair dragged
back in a knob like a door-handle, and <i>hideous</i>
clothes. She would hardly speak to a man, and
was horrified at everything and everybody. And
now behold her, with a fringe, and dressed as well
as anyone in the place, and, of all men, the irresistible
Mr. Kennard in attendance. The boys'
brigade appears to have been disbanded in his
favour. He likes the field to himself.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What will be the end of it, do you think?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The other shrugged her shoulders. &quot;What
has been the end of all his affairs with women?
Scandal and unpleasantness for them, and certainly,
in one instance at least, disgrace and
divorce, while he has gone scot free. He was
notorious before he came here from the Punjaub,
and yet he goes on as if nothing had happened.
Some people run after him because he's a rich
barrister and can entertain, and gives himself airs.
Look at that little idiot over there, hanging on his
every word. Her husband would be furious. I
dare say he'll be here in a minute, and then we
shall see.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Mrs. Greaves left her seat. She intended that
these &quot;tattle-snakes,&quot; as she dubbed all scandalmongers,
should suffer disappointment. If she
could help it there should be no thrilling little
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page63" id="page63"></a>[pg&nbsp;63]</span>
scene for them to witness with malevolent enjoyment.
Deliberately she made her way across the
room towards the couple under observation.</p>

<p class="indent">Mr. Kennard rose at once and gave her his
chair, drawing another one forward for himself.
He looked very handsome, very self-contained;
even Mrs. Greaves was grudgingly conscious of
his attraction, much as she distrusted and disliked
him.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Rafella,&quot; she began in plausible entreaty,
&quot;could you possibly give me a lift home? My old
man has evidently forgotten that he was to pick
me up on his way back from polo, and we've people
coming to dinner. I shall hardly have time to
make the salad and put out the dessert!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Mrs. Coventry hesitated perceptibly. She
looked at Mr. Kennard, who did not return her
glance. His face was blandly impassive.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Are you waiting for your husband?&quot; inquired
Mrs. Greaves. &quot;If so, perhaps Mr. Kennard
would drive me home.&quot; She hoped with fervour
that her own husband would not arrive inconveniently,
before she could complete her man&#339;uvre.</p>

<p class="indent">Mrs. Greaves, remembering that Mr. Kennard's
bungalow was next door to that of the Coventrys,
felt more than ever determined to lure Rafella
away, and to take the opportunity of speaking her
mind. She, of course, could not know that Mrs.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page64" id="page64"></a>[pg&nbsp;64]</span>
Coventry had intended to remain at the club till
her husband must have started for the mess. She
was only aware that Rafella was reluctant to leave.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, then,&quot; she said cheerfully, &quot;that's all
right. Would you mind if we started at once?&quot;
She turned to Mr. Kennard. &quot;If my husband
should turn up after all, would you tell him I've
gone? It will serve him right for being so late.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Presently the two women were driving swiftly
along the broad road that led from the club to the
native cavalry lines. Mrs. Greaves kept up a
desultory flow of small talk until they arrived at
the steps of the veranda. Then she said urgently:
&quot;Rafella, I want you to come in for a moment.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But you'll be busy.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No, I shan't. Look here, Rafella, we haven't
anybody dining with us, and Jim hadn't forgotten
to call for me. He's probably at the club now,
and when he finds I've gone home, he'll stay and
play billiards, or something, for a bit. I perjured
myself on your account, and I want you to come
in and hear why I did it.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Unwillingly, and with an air of offended
mystification, Mrs. Coventry complied.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What on earth do you mean?&quot; she inquired
once they were inside the comfortable drawing-room.
&quot;How could you tell me such dreadful
untruths?&quot;<span class="pagenum"><a name="page65" id="page65"></a>[pg&nbsp;65]</span>
She stood, looking disturbed and suspicious,
in the yellow lamplight, while Mrs. Greaves shook
up the fat cushions on the sofa and pushed her
gently in among them. Then she explained. She
repeated part of the conversation she had overheard
at the club, she expressed her own opinion
of Mr. Kennard, and she told Mrs. Coventry in
plain words that she was making a fool of herself.</p>

<p class="indent">Flushed and indignant, Rafella sprang up from
the nest of cushions.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It's intolerable!&quot; she cried. &quot;I won't listen.
You are every bit as bad as those two poisonous
women you overheard talking. Your mind must
be as evil as theirs. I tell you there is no harm
in my friendship with Mr. Kennard; he has been
awfully kind to me, sending me flowers and lending
me books, and I hope I have been of some
help to him; he is grateful, that is all.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;His gratitude will be mistaken by other people
for something not quite so harmless,&quot; warned Mrs.
Greaves; and Rafella did feel a little disturbed in
her conscience as she remembered the tone of his
voice and his use of her Christian name on the
previous night. But she assured herself George
was to blame, indirectly, for that; Mr. Kennard
had forgotten himself at the moment only because
he felt so indignant with George for his conduct
towards her. It was simply an outburst of chivalrous
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page66" id="page66"></a>[pg&nbsp;66]</span>
sympathy, though, of course, she would never
permit it to happen again.</p>

<p class="indent">Marion Greaves was still talking. &quot;As long as
you only played about with a lot of nice, harmless
boys, I knew you were safe enough; but the
moment this man began to single you out----&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I have never 'played about,' as you vulgarly
put it,&quot; interrupted Rafella furiously. &quot;The boys
are just like brothers to me. They miss their
women relations at home, and I can give them
advice, and listen to their troubles, and often help
them very much. They know I don't want them
to make love to me, and that I wouldn't allow such
a thing!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;If you were old and plain, they wouldn't ask
for your help and advice. But that is beside the
point. We are talking now about Mr. Kennard.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;And I tell you again there is no harm in our
friendship, and as long as my conscience is clear
the friendship will continue.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You know your husband hates him,&quot; said
Mrs. Greaves bluntly, &quot;so your conscience can't
be completely clear.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The flush died away from Rafella's cheeks; she
twisted her fingers together, and her voice shook
as she answered defiantly: &quot;He should be the last
person to misjudge me, or to put a wrong construction
on my friendships.&quot;<span class="pagenum"><a name="page67" id="page67"></a>[pg&nbsp;67]</span>
Mrs. Greaves wished to goodness the girl would
break down and cry, then she might be more easy
to manage. But there she stood, pale and pig-headed,
so <i>silly</i>, and the other woman longed to
shake her. Of course the little fool was flattered
by the man's attentions, fatally attracted by his
arts and wiles, and with a husband like Coventry,
who had always been hard on the frailties of
women, intolerant even of harmless flirtation, there
was bound to be serious trouble sooner or later.
What was to be done!</p>

<p class="indent">Mrs. Greaves struggled to keep her temper.
&quot;Well, my dear,&quot; she urged gently, &quot;all I can say
is that you'd better be careful. Mr. Kennard's
friendships with other men's wives have never yet
been regarded as blameless! And I ask you--is
it worth the risk of a row with your husband?
Wouldn't it be wiser to quarrel with Mr. Kennard
than with the man you must live with for the rest
of your life?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Even Rafella could hardly deny the plain
common sense of this pleading. She evaded the
question, repeated that she had done nothing unworthy,
and said that if George could not trust
her----</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, good heavens!&quot; Mrs. Greaves broke in
wearily. &quot;Of course George trusts you. But he
can't bear you to be talked about, and you ought
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page68" id="page68"></a>[pg&nbsp;68]</span>
to consider his feelings. Anyone can see you are
making him jealous. Those women in the club
this evening were thirsting for him to come in and
find you sitting alone with Mr. Kennard.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;India is a wicked place!&quot; cried Rafella;
&quot;full of gossips and scandalmongers and evil-minded
people. Why can't they leave one
alone?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;My good girl, India is no worse than any
other part of the globe that is inhabited by human
beings,&quot; argued Mrs. Greaves; &quot;but out here we
are all necessarily thrown a great deal together,
and women of our class associate with men much
more than is usual or possible for us to do at
home. If we are sensible it does us and the men
no manner of harm, rather the reverse. If we are
fools it may turn our heads, and then, of course,
the men will amuse themselves accordingly.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;My head is not turned,&quot; said Rafella, like a
child; and with an effort Mrs. Greaves forbore to
contradict her. It was clear that nothing further
could be said at present without endangering their
friendship, which for Rafella's sake was not to
be desired.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well, don't let us argue about it any more.
We'll drop the subject. And do stay and dine
with us, as your husband is out to-night and you're
alone.&quot;<span class="pagenum"><a name="page69" id="page69"></a>[pg&nbsp;69]</span>
&quot;No, thank you,&quot; refused Rafella with stiff
politeness; and she went to the door.</p>

<p class="indent">Persuasion failed to move her, and with a
kindly, regretful &quot;good-night&quot; Mrs. Greaves
watched her climb into her trap and drive away.
She had an uneasy suspicion that Rafella's determined
refusal was due not so much to her outraged
feelings as to either the hope, or the certainty,
that Mr. Kennard would come over to see her
during the evening.</p>

<p class="indent">Rafella wept when she got home. She felt
like a persecuted Christian, and she could not touch
her solitary meal. It was true that her conscience
was clear of wrongdoing and of any attempt to
deceive. The differences between herself and her
husband regarding her innocent &quot;friendship&quot; had,
of course, been very distressing, but George was
to blame; he was entirely in the wrong. She
considered that instead of being cross and disagreeable,
George ought to encourage her to exercise
her influence for good, especially with a man
like Mr. Kennard, if all that was said of him was
true--which she did not believe. George's hostility
towards Mr. Kennard had aroused all the obstinacy
in her nature. Her self-esteem was wounded. It
was positively insulting of George to question her
conduct. She might as well suspect him of
gambling because he played cards, or of drinking
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page70" id="page70"></a>[pg&nbsp;70]</span>
because he was not a teetotaller. Whatever George,
or Mrs. Greaves, or anyone else might say, she
was not going to treat Mr. Kennard as though he
were a scoundrel, nor to behave as if she had
done wrong herself. Why should she forgo the
pleasure of his society, and why should she deprive
him of her sympathy and her friendship, which
she knew was of comfort and help to him, merely
because a few spiteful people chose to see evil
where no evil existed?</p>

<p class="indent">After pretending to eat her dinner, she lay
on the sofa and tried to read one of the books
Mr. Kennard had lent her. It was called &quot;Degeneration,&quot;
and she found it very difficult to
follow; still, he had told her that she ought to
take an interest in every phase of human nature,
and she plodded through the first few pages. She
soon found that she could not fix her attention.
As a matter of fact, the subject of the book was
beyond her simple understanding; and, in addition,
she was listening, subconsciously, for footsteps in
the veranda.</p>

<p class="indent">At last she rose and wandered out into the
garden, feeling very lonely, very much aggrieved.
Self-pity overwhelmed her. Looking back upon
the period that had passed since her arrival as a
bride in India, so eager, so happy, so filled with
faith in the future, it all seemed to her like a long
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page71" id="page71"></a>[pg&nbsp;71]</span>
and exhausting dream; and now she was conscious
of nothing but doubt, disillusion, and righteous
indignation.</p>

<p class="indent">And, indeed, the whole machinery of Rafella's
mental outlook was deranged and dislocated. Her
perceptions had been weakened by the effort to
adjust her mind to unaccustomed circumstances,
and she mistook her own failure to resist deterioration
for a sort of jealous plot on the part of other
people to undermine her judgment and her purity
of purpose.</p>

<p class="indent">She paced the patch of drive that showed
ghostly and grey in the starlight. Through the
thin screen of oleander trees that, with a low
mud barrier, divided the Coventrys' compound
from the compound of their neighbour Mr. Kennard,
she could see the lights of his bungalow.
She thought of him with tenderness as one who,
like herself, was a victim of the little-minded. The
voluptuous warmth and peace of the night soothed
her over-excited nerves.... She wished that Mr.
Kennard would come over and talk to her. She
had felt so confident that he would come, if
only for just a few minutes, knowing that she was
alone. A little breeze caressed her face in soft,
warm waves; as she paused beneath the trees they
seemed to lean towards her in the darkness with
whispers of support and consolation. The furtive
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page72" id="page72"></a>[pg&nbsp;72]</span>
noises of the Indian night did not alarm her--a
rustle in the undergrowth, the sudden flapping of
a flying fox, the flitter of a bat, the distant squealing
of some helpless little creature in the agonies
of capture by a foe. She went on, as in a dream,
until she reached the gateless entrance of the compound,
where she paused, standing in the loose
white dust that still retained the heat of the day.
An ekka passed, with jingling bells, along the road
outside, then a creaking cart close-packed with
pilgrims on their journey to some sacred shrine,
chanting sleepily a song of prayer and praise.
Silent-footed travellers, enshrouded in their cotton
sheets, slipped by and disappeared like wraiths.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Mrs. Coventry--is that you?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Involuntarily she started, though she knew she
did not feel surprised. Kennard had come out of
his gate, and was standing at her side; she had
not heard his footsteps in the dust. His figure,
in the starlight, looked black and indistinct, save
for his white shirt-front and the burning end of
his cigar. It suddenly struck Rafella that, since
she had known Mr. Kennard, the odour of strong
cigars was no longer repugnant to her--she who
had always detested the smell of tobacco, who had
never grown really accustomed to George's innumerable
cigarettes! Vaguely she wondered why
this should be, as he stood talking--talking, she
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page73" id="page73"></a>[pg&nbsp;73]</span>
noticed, as superficially as if they had been in a
room full of listening people--about the warmth
of the night and the approaching hot weather, and
how difficult it was to settle down to a book or
anything else in a stuffy bungalow after dinner,
with mosquitoes biting one's ankles, etc. Rafella
appreciated the delicacy of his attitude; she
thought it exceedingly nice of him not to attempt
to take any advantage of the situation. And yet
if George were to see them together now, he would
straightway assume that Mr. Kennard was making
love to her, and that she was allowing him to
do so!</p>

<p class="indent">The thought of her husband gave her a feeling
of uneasiness. She did not know how long it was
since she had left the house; it might have been
equally hours or minutes ago as far as she was
concerned; George might return any moment and
discover her here by the road in the darkness with
Mr. Kennard, and of course he would never
believe----</p>

<p class="indent">She said: &quot;I think I had better go back.&quot; Yet
still she lingered, captive to the magic of the night,
and the heavy scent of blossoms mingling with
the fumes of his cheroot; held, also, by the lurement
of his presence, and a novel sense of high
adventure.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You know you ought not to come out at night
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page74" id="page74"></a>[pg&nbsp;74]</span>
without a lantern,&quot; he told her. &quot;It's just the
time of year when snakes begin to lie about in the
dust and are still half-torpid from the winter.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Then why did <i>you</i> come out without a lantern?&quot;
she asked, picking up her skirts a little
anxiously.</p>

<p class="indent">At first he did not answer. Then he said:
&quot;Perhaps I'd better not explain.&quot; He paused.
&quot;After all,&quot; he added, &quot;I don't see why I shouldn't
tell you. The truth is I just felt I <i>must</i> come and
stand at your gate, and I forgot all about lanterns
and snakes.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Why couldn't you have come over, lantern
and all, after dinner for a chat?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">She would not recognise his meaning, thrilled
though she was by his homage.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I knew you were alone. Would it have been
wise?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well, perhaps not,&quot; she agreed, &quot;and it's also
not wise for us to stay talking here in the dark
with snakes all over the place; I must go in.
Good-night, Mr. Kennard.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">He held her hand. &quot;You'll keep me some
dances to-morrow night, won't you? I'm one of
your hosts, remember. Promise you won't disappoint
me?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Of course not,&quot; she promised him gently,
withdrawing her hand.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page75" id="page75"></a>[pg&nbsp;75]</span>
He hesitated. &quot;I think I'll just see you as far
as the steps of the veranda. I should feel more
comfortable. I can go back by the gap in the
boundary--where it's broken, you know.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">She knew. He had often come over that way
in the daytime.</p>

<p class="indent">They strolled to the veranda steps in silence;
then again they said &quot;Good-night,&quot; and Kennard
vanished swiftly in the darkness.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Won't you borrow one of our lanterns?&quot; she
called after him, remembering with horror the
danger of snakes.</p>

<p class="indent">There came no answer, for at that moment
Rafella's husband drove in at the gate.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Were you calling to someone?&quot; he inquired,
with surly suspicion, as he joined her in the
veranda.</p>

<p class="indent">For the first time in her life Rafella told a
deliberate lie. &quot;No,&quot; she said, her heart fluttering
painfully with fear and shame. &quot;I had only just
come out to listen for the trap.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VI" id="CHAPTER_VI"></a>CHAPTER VI</h2>

<p class="h2a">THE BACHELORS' BALL</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> rhythm of the immortal &quot;Blue Danube&quot; waltz
swung through the big Indian ballroom. It was
long before two-steps, Bostons, tangos were
dreamed of, when, at any rate in India, the <i>pas de
quatre</i> was still a novelty, and the &quot;Washington
Post&quot; had not yet been introduced. Almost everyone
was dancing; the only onlookers were a few
partnerless, or non-dancing men, and a sprinkling
of senior people whose exile in the East was nearly
over. The aged white man or woman is seldom
to be encountered in India; they have &quot;done their
time&quot; and gone home--or to their graves. Sometimes
they stay to live out last years in some more
or less salubrious region, but such settlers are
dying out, and, with easier transit home, are not
replaced; for though living may be less expensive,
and cheap luxuries attractive, there is always the
loss of prestige and the desire to end their days in
England.</p>

<p class="indent">There seemed no doubt that the final ball of
the cold weather season was a triumphant success.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page77" id="page77"></a>[pg&nbsp;77]</span>
The bachelor hosts had spared neither effort nor
money to perfect every arrangement, from the par excellent
supper upstairs to the most trifling detail
below. The compound of the public building was
illuminated with row upon row of little lights in
coloured glass receptacles, verandas were enclosed
and decorated, tents were added too, carpeted and
furnished, for the benefit of sitters-out; plants were
in profusion, flowers, Chinese lanterns, casual
buffets for promiscuous refreshment--nothing was
forgotten.</p>

<p class="indent">Every girl had partners, the programmes of the
more popular spinsters had been filled for days,
and usually hopeless wallflowers were not allowed
to sit neglected as long as a man who could dance
was unwary enough to remain unattached in the
ballroom. Even the most unattractive of the three
Miss Planes (&quot;Plain,&quot; &quot;Plainer,&quot; &quot;Plainest,&quot; as
they were called by irreverent subalterns) had been
dancing all night, and as a result of enjoyment
looked almost attractive.</p>

<p class="indent">Among the non-dancing men was Captain
Coventry; entertainments of this description bored
him unutterably. Polo and sport were his recreations,
and he could not and would not dance; it
was a form of amusement he held in contempt.
To-night he felt more disinclined than usual to
make himself useful or pleasant. Sullen and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page78" id="page78"></a>[pg&nbsp;78]</span>
solitary, he leaned against the wall in gloomy
contrast with the gay festoons of muslin, blue and
white and yellow, draped behind him. He was
a man not seen at his best in a ballroom, and just
at that moment he appeared at his worst, for his
wife had danced four times already with the man
he most loathed in the station, and again she was
dancing with him now. The pair swept by, Kennard
tall and dark and serene, Rafella radiant,
flushed, abandoned to pleasure, both of them regardless
of the sombre, jealous eyes that watched
them from the wall.</p>

<p class="indent">Mrs. Greaves, having twisted her ankle romping
through a set of lancers, had now taken refuge
on the dais for a precautionary rest; and she also
watched the fairy figure floating round the room.
Her neighbour on the red velvet settee happened
to be the consort of a high official, a wise and
benevolent lady, whose long experience of Indian
life had only increased her natural kindness of
heart and broadened her tolerant views.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You know the Coventrys rather well, don't
you, Mrs. Greaves?&quot; she asked, as she followed
the direction of the other woman's eyes. The
question was not prompted by trivial curiosity,
nor by any desire for ungenerous gossip, and of
this Mrs. Greaves was fully aware, knowing her
companion's disposition.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page79" id="page79"></a>[pg&nbsp;79]</span>
&quot;I thought I knew Mrs. Coventry well,&quot; she
said doubtfully, &quot;but lately I've not felt quite
sure. Can you believe that when she came out
she considered it wrong to dress becomingly, or
to do anything that might improve her appearance?
And she thought we were all so fast and
frivolous! She has altered so curiously.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I am sorry for her, poor, pretty little person.&quot;
The elder woman's placid face grew sad. &quot;She
is a typical example of the kind of girl who deteriorates
rapidly in India; and then people at
home, who won't try to understand, think India
is to blame. She would have been just the same
in England, or anywhere else, if she had been
pitchforked into a different kind of life. If she
doesn't come to grief, as I fear seems likely, she
will probably go home and talk about her servants
and her carriage and her men friends, and help
to spread the false impression that out here all
English women live like princesses and are nothing
but brainless butterflies. It is such a mistake!
She means no harm, I am sure, which makes it
all the more regrettable.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I also think she is far more to be pitied than
blamed,&quot; agreed Mrs. Greaves. &quot;She led such a
narrow little life at home in a country vicarage,
as far as I can gather from what she has told me
at different times; and somehow it does seem to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page80" id="page80"></a>[pg&nbsp;80]</span>
have unbalanced her to have a lady's maid, as
she would call her ayah at first, and a smart dog-cart
and big rooms, and plenty of society, and to
discover that she was pretty and attractive. The
worst of it is Captain Coventry doesn't understand
the situation in the least, and makes no
allowance.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;He ought not to leave her so much to look
after herself. He appears to be always out shooting,
or playing cricket or racquets or polo, when
he isn't on duty. I suppose he's the wrong kind
of husband for an undeveloped creature like that.
She ought to have married a curate at home, or a
small country squire; then she would probably
have remained contented all her life, teaching in
the Sunday school, and visiting the cottagers, and
doing good according to her own ideas.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You see,&quot; explained Mrs. Greaves, &quot;at first
Captain Coventry was only rather amused at the
way many of her little scruples fizzled out, and
treated her like a child--after all, in some ways
she isn't much more--until she began to do things
that most of us deprecate, though we know they
are probably harmless enough. When she took
up with this horrible man he got angry, and
they had rows. You know, I dare say, how intolerant
he is; he always thinks the worst of
women. I have never really liked him, and I'm
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page81" id="page81"></a>[pg&nbsp;81]</span>
afraid, if it were not for Rafella's sake, I should
feel rather pleased, in a way, that his selection
had not turned out quite the paragon of propriety
he expected.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Can't you do anything? Can't you speak to
her? I don't feel I know her sufficiently well to
interfere.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I did try, but it was hopeless. She seemed
to think she was the only person with any principles
in the station. She said I had an evil mind,
that we all had evil minds, and she stuck to it
that she was doing nothing wrong; and, literally
speaking, I am sure she isn't; she's only being
foolish. She declared that as long as her conscience
was clear she did not see why she should
give up her friendship with Mr. Kennard.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I cannot abide that man! What on earth
do some women see in him--or some men either,
for that matter? It makes me so angry to hear
them alluding to 'dear old Kennard.' No doubt
he is clever--all barristers are; but I consider that
no woman can be seen about with him and keep
her reputation. I don't wonder Captain Coventry
looks like a bear with a sore head. I hope he
will soon put his foot down and stop the flirtation
altogether.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes, if he only does it the right way,&quot; said
Mrs. Greaves doubtfully; and as the music ceased
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page82" id="page82"></a>[pg&nbsp;82]</span>
she observed, with apprehension, that Mr. Kennard
and Mrs. Coventry were making for a
screened-in, dimly lit veranda, and that Captain
Coventry was following the couple with slow, determined
steps.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh!&quot; she exclaimed involuntarily, below
her breath, &quot;I hope there isn't going to be a
row!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;My dear,&quot; the Commissioner's wife assured
her, &quot;Mr. Kennard will take care there is no row--in
public, at any rate. That would not suit him
at all.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But Rafella is so silly, and Captain Coventry
is so hard and vindictive. What will be the end
of it?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;If anyone goes to the wall, it will without
question be the woman,&quot; said the other grimly;
&quot;that is what always happens in these deplorable
cases.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Captain Coventry came upon his wife and her
partner seated in an alcove. The pink glow from
a paper lantern fell on the woman's fair head and
delicate neck. She looked the picture of purity
and innocence. The pair might have sat as models
for Faust and Marguerite. Rafella glanced up
quickly as her husband approached, walking
slowly, evenly, along the veranda between the rows
of sitting-out couples. She avoided his eyes as he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page83" id="page83"></a>[pg&nbsp;83]</span>
came to a halt in front of her. Apparently Mr.
Kennard did not see him.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Are you ready to come home?&quot; he asked in
a cold, level voice.</p>

<p class="indent">Then she looked up in nervous appeal. &quot;Oh,
George, there are three more dances besides the
extras on the programme!&quot; She turned as though
for sympathy and support to the man who sat silent
at her side, toying with her fan. He only smiled
inscrutably, and his eyes held the expression of
one looking on at a comedy.</p>

<p class="indent">Captain Coventry stood rigid; his hands were
clenched, his face hard and set.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It is time for us to go home,&quot; he said, with
a faint though unmistakable emphasis on the
pronoun.</p>

<p class="indent">She moved a small, satin-shod foot impatiently.
&quot;Oh, do let us stay a little longer,&quot; she protested;
&quot;nobody is going yet.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;<i>We</i> are,&quot; said her husband.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Why?&quot; she demanded in desperate defiance.
Then she looked frightened, and rose with reluctance
from her seat.</p>

<p class="indent">For a moment she glanced from one man to
the other, disconcerted because Mr. Kennard had
said nothing, had not asserted his claim to the
dances that still were his on her programme.
Suddenly she felt helpless, deserted, indignant.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page84" id="page84"></a>[pg&nbsp;84]</span>
Mr. Kennard must think she was not her own
mistress, that she could not do as she chose, that
she allowed herself to be treated like a child. It
was insufferable! Why couldn't George trust her?
He ought to be glad to see her receiving admiration
and attention. It was odious of him to place
her in such a false and unpleasant position. But
while that hard, cruel look remained in his eyes
she dared not defy him. She would have to obey
like a slave at the moment, though she vowed to
herself that she would demand an apology once
they were alone.</p>

<p class="indent">She rose with an air of offended pride, and held
out her hand for her fan. Kennard gave it to her
with a bow, and a suppressed smile on his face
that made Coventry long to knock him down.
They bade each other formal good-nights, and
Rafella stalked in the direction of the cloakroom,
her head held high, her husband following her
close.</p>

<p class="indent">On their way back to their bungalow there was
silence between the Coventrys. They were driving
in the cab of the country, a rough vehicle that resembled
a palanquin on wheels, with venetian
shutters instead of windows, and the noise it made
would have rendered even the most amiable of conversations
impossible. The air outside was warm
and still, and the rattle of the wheels and the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page85" id="page85"></a>[pg&nbsp;85]</span>
woodwork, and the clumsy harness, seemed intensified
by the surrounding silence of the Indian
night. The stuffy conveyance was filled with the
scent of violets--lately Rafella had taken to scent,
strong scent that clung and impregnated everything
she wore. At her breast was a cluster of
violets that had come from the pots in Mr.
Kennard's veranda, and now, dying, the flowers
gave out a stale fragrance. To the angry man
at her side the concentrated perfume was atrocious.
It seemed to be connected in some subtle way with
the alteration in his wife's behaviour--to breathe
of all that was false and worthless in a woman's
heart. Bitterly he blamed the follies and temptations
of Indian life, and her failure to withstand
them. It did not occur to him that, with her
limited intelligence, her inexperience of life, and
her undeveloped outlook, things would have been
the same in any quarter of the earth, given the
scope and opportunity. He was a man who could
not make allowances, who could perceive no point
of view except his own; yet withal he was a straight
and honourable English soldier, with high standards
of right and wrong, and a deep sense of the
sanctity of marriage. Such people are often incapable
of distinguishing between mere foolishness
and sin; they will argue that there are no degrees
of infidelity, and that a false step necessarily implies
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page86" id="page86"></a>[pg&nbsp;86]</span>
complete downfall. Coventry had no sympathy
with sexual temptation; in his sight, if a
married woman permitted a man who was not her
husband to make love to her, she was guilty of
more than indiscretion.</p>

<p class="indent">His anger kept him silent as they entered their
bungalow. He was afraid to trust himself to speak.</p>

<p class="indent">It was his wife who precipitated the storm; she
turned up the lamp that was burning low on a
table in the drawing-room, and threw her cloak
on to a chair with a petulant movement. The
atmosphere of the room was oppressive, yet
Coventry had re-bolted the long glass door by
which they had entered. Mosquitoes, disturbed by
the light, flew with thin screamings around their
heads.</p>

<p class="indent">For a moment they looked at each other. The
man's eyes were cold and contemptuous, and the
woman's sense of injury and injustice increased
till she felt wellnigh desperate. To think that
she should have been dragged home like a naughty
little girl from a party, who must be sent to bed
as a punishment, while everyone else was still
dancing and enjoying the ball!--and Mr. Kennard
would have found another partner whose husband
was not a monster of unreasonable jealousy. Perhaps
he would smile and shrug his shoulders,
and cease now to send her violets every morning,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page87" id="page87"></a>[pg&nbsp;87]</span>
and no longer single her out for special attention,
or send her little notes asking what were her plans
for the afternoon--or give her books with quotations
inscribed by himself on the flyleaf: quotations
conveying a harmless though flattering homage.
In short, all the little inarticulate attentions that
to the initiated are but the preliminaries to a game
that need be no more than an emotional pastime,
but may be fraught with peril to the flattered
novitiate.</p>

<p class="indent">Instinctively her hand rested on a small, beautifully
bound volume that had come this morning
with the violets she wore, whose perfume stirred
her senses even at this moment as it floated out
into the room. On the title page was traced in
Kennard's peculiar writing:</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i4">&quot;A book of verses underneath the bough,</span>
<span class="i4">A jug of wine, a loaf of bread, and <i>thou</i></span>
<span class="i4">Beside me, singing in the wilderness--</span>
<span class="i4">Oh! wilderness were paradise enow.&quot;</span>
</div>
</div>

<p class="indent">&quot;Aren't you going to explain?&quot; she demanded
in a stifled voice. &quot;You have made me the
laughing-stock of the station. You have spoilt
my evening. Do you expect me to submit without
a word? I am not a child, let me tell you; I am
capable of taking care of myself.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Apparently that is just what you are not
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page88" id="page88"></a>[pg&nbsp;88]</span>
capable of doing,&quot; said Coventry. &quot;Unless you
promise me to behave decently in future, and unless
you do so, I shall send you home to your father
until my time is up in India.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">A sudden remembrance of the shabby vicarage
assailed her, and the dull little village, and the
routine of housework, and economy; Sunday
school, choir practice, parish duties, old people,
the long dark winters, and the cold, and the rain,
and the solitude. It chilled her spirit, and filled
her with a sickening dread. Yet how could she
bring herself to promise &quot;to behave with decency,&quot;
when, in her own opinion, she had done nothing
reprehensible? Her &quot;friendship&quot; with Mr. Kennard
was blameless on both sides. It might be
true that he did not bear the best of characters;
Mrs. Greaves had warned her, most officiously, of
that, and had cited one or two so-called scandals
in which he had been concerned, to all appearances,
discreditably. But had he not told her
himself, repeatedly, that it had all been the fault
of the women, which she could quite believe, and
that her influence on his life was the one good
thing that had ever come his way? Had he not
declared that for her sweet sake there should be
no more &quot;stories,&quot; that because of her he would
be strong? Surely that was something to be
proud of! Therefore, how could she turn and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page89" id="page89"></a>[pg&nbsp;89]</span>
treat him as though he were a blackguard, and
deny him the first incentive he had ever known to
rectitude of life? Why, every Sunday lately he
had gone to church at her behest, and he said he
had given up gambling at the club, assured her
that every night he read a chapter of the Bible she
had lent him--a worn little volume that had been
hers since childhood, with notes in the margins,
and flowers pressed between the pages to mark the
anniversaries of her life's rare events--her mother's
death, her confirmation, her first communion, and
her marriage.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well?&quot; Her husband's voice cut sharply
through her thoughts.</p>

<p class="indent">Now she gazed at him with large, distressed
blue eyes.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, George, do try to understand! There is
really nothing wrong. We are only friends, and
he <i>needs</i> my friendship; it helps him, it does him
good.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Rage and disgust almost choked him. &quot;Bah!&quot;
he exclaimed furiously, &quot;don't talk rot like that to
me.&quot; He took a step forward, and seized her
wrist. &quot;Can you swear to me that the beast has
never attempted to make love to you? Can you
deny that he follows you about, and writes you
notes, and gives you presents, and that you have
never tried to stop him? The fellow is notorious,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page90" id="page90"></a>[pg&nbsp;90]</span>
and only a man who was a fool or a blackguard
would stand by and see his wife go to the devil
with him or with anyone else.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">She trembled, terrified, and her face became
distorted with tears. &quot;You are cruel and unjust,&quot;
she sobbed. &quot;I will not bear it.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">He dropped her arm, and paced backwards
and forwards among the furniture. Then he
stopped by the table and picked up a book--the
daintily bound little volume that had come for
Rafella this morning. He looked at it with
contempt.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;This is the kind of unwholesome rot he
tries to poison your mind with.&quot; He opened the
cover, and read the verse on the fly-leaf; next
moment he flung the book to the farther end of
the room.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;That is enough,&quot; he said. &quot;Listen to me!
If you don't promise me this instant never to speak
to the man again, I'll--I'll kill you.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Coventry was beside himself with passion, for
it seemed to him that his honour, his home, his
name was besmirched. He felt humiliated,
wronged; and the primitive sense of outraged
possession had him in its grip. Nothing could
ever be the same again between his wife and himself.
It was all he could do not to strike her as
she stood there, white, and fair, and weak, at
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page91" id="page91"></a>[pg&nbsp;91]</span>
his mercy, yet still with a frightened defiance in
her childish blue eyes.</p>

<p class="indent">There followed a tense pause, as with set teeth
he strove to master his passion, holding his
clenched hands down on the table before him....
And suddenly the silence outside was broken by
the sound of wheels and the sharp trotting of a
horse's hoofs that turned into the adjoining compound
and ceased. Instinctively Rafella turned
her head and listened. Mr. Kennard had come
home from the ball. The knowledge that he was
at hand gave her a feeling of partial security.
That, together with indignation and resentment,
kept her firm in her resolve not to be browbeaten
into a promise that could only be an admission of
guilt. She could not perceive that morally she
had erred, though actually she was innocent of
wrongdoing. It was precisely what her husband
could not perceive either; to him there was little
difference.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Are you going to promise?&quot; he asked, with
menace in his voice.</p>

<p class="indent">She put up her hands as though to shield herself
from violence.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Are you going to promise?&quot; he said again,
and moved a little nearer.</p>

<p class="indent">Then her courage failed her. She was afraid
of George, afraid of the look on his face that reminded
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page92" id="page92"></a>[pg&nbsp;92]</span>
her of a savage animal--afraid of his
threats, and his voice, and his presence. She
turned and ran to the door that had been bolted
by him as they entered. He followed her. She
screamed, stretching her white arms up to the bolt,
dragging it down.</p>

<p class="indent">Next moment she was outside, running in silent
terror towards the house in the next compound.
The lightly clad figure sped like a ghost through
the dim light of the coming dawn, and stumbled
through the gap in the low mud boundary, leaving
George Coventry standing on the threshold of his
house as though he had been turned to stone.</p>

<p class="indent">Motionless he stood; then he laughed like a
drunken man, and reeled back into the room that
smelt of matting and lamp-oil and--violets.</p>

<hr />

<p class="indent">The disappearance of Mr. Kennard and Mrs.
Coventry came as a veritable bombshell to the
station. Nobody knew exactly what had happened;
there were so many different stories.
Hitherto people had noticed and talked, some with
jealous interest, others more or less good-naturedly,
a few with real regret, but none with any expectation
of a serious scandal; for domestic disaster is
rare in India, in spite of popular delusion to the
contrary. And when it occurs, partly because of
its rarity, partly because in any community so
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page93" id="page93"></a>[pg&nbsp;93]</span>
intimate as one class of the same nationality in
exile, such an occurrence goes sharply home, and
creates a sensation at once so painful and exciting
that it is not quickly forgotten.</p>

<p class="indent">It was said that Mrs. Coventry had deliberately
left her husband after a terrible scene; another
version was that she had confessed on the night of
the bachelors' ball to conduct such as had left
Captain Coventry no alternative but to allow her
to go; again that he had turned her out, and she
had sought refuge in Mr. Kennard's bungalow.
Someone had seen the runaway couple leaving
next day by the mail train for Bombay. The more
charitable maintained that the injured husband had
been chiefly to blame; he had made a mountain
out of a molehill, would listen to no explanation,
nor give the benefit of any doubt, driving his wife
to the ruinous step she had taken.</p>

<p class="indent">All that remained evident was that Mrs.
Coventry and Mr. Kennard were no longer seen in
the station, and that for a short space of time
Captain Coventry continued to perform his regimental
duties, to play polo and racquets and
cricket, in taciturn silence. His bearing inhibited
questions, or mention to him of what had occurred;
no one dared to intrude on his secret, and his
reticence was respected. A little later he took leave
on urgent private affairs and went home; and in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page94" id="page94"></a>[pg&nbsp;94]</span>
due time an undefended divorce case, with Mr.
Kennard as co-respondent, was reported without
detail in the papers.</p>

<p class="indent">Mr. Kennard was eventually heard of in another
Province, where, from all accounts, he was as
popular as ever with a certain section of society
always to be found anywhere, people who are
attracted by good dinners and a display of wealth
and an apparently superior knowledge of the world,
who are content to ask no questions--which they
call minding their own business.</p>

<p class="indent">Gossip subsided with the fluctuation of the
European population of a large Indian station,
where the military portion come and go, and civil
officials are constantly transferred. Captain
Coventry did not come back; he exchanged into
the home battalion of his regiment. There came
echoes and whispers that little Mrs. Coventry had
returned to India after the decree had been made
absolute, under the confiding impression that Mr.
Kennard would make her his wife. But some
declared that, of course, he was not such a fool;
others that he had been blackguard enough to
refuse to marry her; and what became of her
nobody knew, and very few cared; for, after all,
it was no one's immediate affair.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VII" id="CHAPTER_VII"></a>CHAPTER VII</h2>

<p class="h2a">TRIXIE</p>

<p><span class="smcap">It</span> was sixteen years since the night of the ball in
India when Mrs. Greaves had twisted her ankle,
and had sat on the dais with the wife of a senior
civilian discussing the unfortunate domestic affairs
of Captain and Mrs. Coventry.</p>

<p class="indent">Now Mrs. Greaves's husband was a retired
colonel, and they were living comfortably, if dully,
within their means in a convenient suburb of
London, engrossed in the careers of their boys,
content with their surroundings, with their well-built
villa, their well-trained maids, their patch of
garden and their neighbours--mostly staunch old
Indian friends.</p>

<p class="indent">Until lately Mrs. Munro, now for years a
widow, had been one of these neighbours, living
quietly with Trixie her daughter at the end of the
Greaves's road in a little house called &quot;Almorah.&quot;
Hereabouts many of the houses bore names
reminiscent of India--rather pathetic links with a
past that some of the occupants frequently glorified
into &quot;happier days,&quot; forgetting as frequently how
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page96" id="page96"></a>[pg&nbsp;96]</span>
they had pined for an English home while living
in exile. More or less unconsciously the little
colony of &quot;old Indians&quot; preserved among themselves
various propensities acquired during their
service abroad. For example, they bought each
others' furniture, borrowed and loaned belongings
with ready good nature, paid informal visits chiefly
in the mornings, quarrelled sometimes about
nothing, and were inclined to be exclusive outside
their own circle.</p>

<p class="indent">They were all very happy and comfortable in
spite of past glories, whether real or imagined, and
when Trixie Munro grew up and clamoured for
change, her godmother, Marion Greaves (&quot;Gommie,&quot;
as Trixie had called her ever since she could
talk), urged Ellen Munro to let well alone and
stay where she was--to pay no attention to
Trixie's ridiculous hankerings after a London flat.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You can't afford the move, my dear,&quot; she had
said with truth, &quot;and the sooner Trixie learns that
other things matter besides her own whims the
better.&quot; Trixie and Gommie were more often at
war than on terms of peace.</p>

<p class="indent">However, persuasions and warnings failed, the
obstacle being that the mother's whole life was
bound up in the child, and for Trixie to be disappointed
meant double distress for Mrs. Munro.
Therefore the removal from &quot;Almorah&quot; to the flat
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page97" id="page97"></a>[pg&nbsp;97]</span>
in West Kensington, which was all Mrs. Munro
could achieve on her income, had been accomplished
in direct opposition to Mrs. Greaves's
concerned and strenuous advice.</p>

<p class="indent">Now, on a wet afternoon in January Mrs.
Greaves was starting from her suburban home to
have tea in &quot;Mulberry Mansions, West Kensington,
W.,&quot; with Ellen Munro. Though her once
crisp chestnut hair was faded and grey, and her
sharp little face had lost its freshness and its
freckles--no longer could she claim to be called
&quot;The Plover's Egg&quot;--she had kept her health and
her trimness of figure, and had lost none of her
practical, vigorous grip on existence.</p>

<p class="indent">She selected an umbrella--not her best--from
the stand in the hall, and opened the front door.
A cold, wet wind blew into her face; the outlook
was not encouraging, and the walk to the station
would hardly be pleasant in such horrible weather.
But with her usual determination she closed the
door firmly behind her, giving it a pull to make
sure it was shut, and set off in the wind and the
rain undaunted. She trudged down the hill,
traversed a long stretch of road bounded chiefly
by boards that advertised plots of &quot;desirable&quot; land
for building, and arrived at the tram-riddled town.
On the way to the station, she entered a flower
shop and purchased a large bunch of violets.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page98" id="page98"></a>[pg&nbsp;98]</span>
When she emerged from the underground
railway station into the muddy London street, she
had to wrestle with the second-best umbrella that
endeavoured to turn inside out. It was a ten
minutes' walk to the Munros' little flat, and that
she was carrying the large bunch of violets in a
paper cone added to her difficulties in the wind
and the rain; but she was wearing an old coat and
skirt, and she felt it would be an unnecessary extravagance
to take a cab. Ellen Munro would
provide shoes and stockings while her own were
being dried in the kitchen. She knew that Ellen
was at home only to herself on the periodical occasions
when she came up from the suburb for tea
and a talk over old times.</p>

<p class="indent">The cold and the wet and the gloom of this
January day had not deterred her from the expedition,
for Ellen Munro had written to say she had
an important communication to impart to her old
friend, and, as a human being as well as an old
friend, Marion Greaves was agog to know the
news. She speculated as to what it could possibly
be as she paddled along the slippery pavement;
in all probability it was something connected with
Trixie, and she wondered what the tiresome girl
had been doing now. Seeing that Trixie was her
goddaughter, Mrs. Greaves felt she was entitled
to interfere when the child behaved more outrageously
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page99" id="page99"></a>[pg&nbsp;99]</span>
than usual. She had always considered that
Ellen Munro was not sufficiently strict with the
girl, allowing Trixie to be capricious and extravagant
and to do just as she chose! The result
some day must certainly be disastrous. What else
could be expected when the mother was so weak
and indulgent, and the daughter so selfish and
irresponsible? The modern girl seemed to be a
terrible problem, and Mrs. Greaves felt glad she
had only to think of two sons, who were shaping
well and would soon be supporting themselves.</p>

<p class="indent">She was thankful, presently, to find herself in
the warm, though shabby, little drawing-room that
was pathetically embellished with Indian relics--embroideries
that were dulled with the London
atmosphere, bits of brass and Cashmere silverwork
that the cook-general had no time to clean, intricate
carvings of scented wood, warped and dusty. She
laid her offering of violets on a chair, where it
lay neglected in the little bustle of greeting and
the shedding of her wet shoes. She had bought
the flowers for Ellen, who had plenty of vases,
though she could seldom fill them, she could not
afford niceties; every extra penny was needed for
Trixie, so that Trixie need not go ill-dressed among
her young friends--friends of whom Mrs. Munro
inwardly disapproved, yet could not refuse to
acknowledge without unpleasantness with Trixie.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page100" id="page100"></a>[pg&nbsp;100]</span>
Silly, irresponsible boys and girls, who practically
ignored Mrs. Munro when they came to the flat,
and made up parties with Trixie for second-rate
subscription dances, afternoons and evenings at
skating rinks, tango teas, river picnics, and so on.
Trixie's mother strove to give her daughter adequate
pocket-money, so that taxi fares, gloves,
sweets, cigarettes should not become too acceptable
from young men friends.</p>

<p class="indent">Soon the visitor's feet were dry and warm, the
cook-general had at last ceased to come in and out
of the room, and the tea-kettle was boiling.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Now,&quot; said Mrs. Greaves, &quot;what is it?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Trixie is going to be married.&quot; Trixie's
mother did not look at her old friend as she spoke.
She gazed into the fire, and there was a certain
defensiveness in her voice.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Good gracious, my dear Ellen, why didn't you
tell me in your letter?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You are the first person I have told,&quot; said
Mrs. Munro evasively.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well, are you pleased? Who is he? Has
he any money?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I suppose I am pleased, but he is so much
older than Trixie.&quot; There was a pause.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Really, Ellen, considering we have known
each other since we were girls, I think you might
be a little more anxious to tell me all about it.&quot;<span class="pagenum"><a name="page101" id="page101"></a>[pg&nbsp;101]</span>
&quot;I know I must seem horrid, but it has been
worrying me rather, and I hardly know yet what
to feel or say.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;At any rate, tell me the man's name?&quot; Mrs.
Greaves regarded the worn, white face of her friend
with impatient anxiety. Incidentally, she wished
Ellen would leave off her mourning; she had been
a widow for so many years, and black had never
suited her.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It is Colonel Coventry,&quot; said Ellen, with an
effort.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Coventry? Surely not the man we knew in
India--in the Barchesters?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Mrs. Munro nodded, and there was silence between
the two women, who were both thinking of
Trixie, aged nineteen, pretty, pleasure-loving,
wilful, as the wife of a man nearly thirty years her
senior; a man, moreover, who had been noted for
his intolerance of feminine frailty, for his almost
puritanical views where the conduct of women was
concerned. How could such a marriage prove a
success on either side?</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But, Ellen----&quot; began Mrs. Greaves, and
hesitated. Then she added quickly: &quot;Does Trixie
know that he was married before, and that he
divorced his wife?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes; she doesn't seem to mind. She says it
was all such a long time ago. You know what
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page102" id="page102"></a>[pg&nbsp;102]</span>
Trixie is when she has made up her mind and
wants to do a thing.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I know what girls are nowadays, and Trixie
in particular,&quot; said Mrs. Greaves rather tartly. &quot;I
suppose Colonel Coventry's first marriage must
seem prehistoric to her, but sixteen years to us
is not so long ago. At any rate, let us hope it will
steady her to be married to a man old enough to
be her father.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Mrs. Munro's soft eyes filled with tears. She
said in plaintive protest: &quot;You are always so hard
on Trixie, Marion. There is no real harm in the
child. She only likes to enjoy herself in her own
way.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;She will not be permitted to enjoy herself in
her own way as Mrs. Coventry, unless he has
altered very much since I knew him. It will have
to be his way or nothing. Ellen, I should not like
to see a girl of mine, however well balanced,
married to that man. I believe him to be hard
and unsympathetic. Remember how he behaved to
his first wife, even as a comparatively young man.
The whole station blamed him.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I was at home that year; it was after I took
Trixie home; but I remember hearing about the
case. Surely Mrs. Coventry only got what she
deserved? How could he have done anything but
divorce her when he found out what she was?&quot;<span class="pagenum"><a name="page103" id="page103"></a>[pg&nbsp;103]</span>
&quot;My dear, I always doubted if there was anything
to find out beyond extreme foolishness,
though appearances were certainly against her. I
knew her fairly well, and I never for one moment
thought she had been really bad. George Coventry
was one of those men who are ready to believe the
worst about women, and who pose as saints themselves.
Does Trixie profess to be in love with him,
may I ask?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;She seems happy. He's very good-looking,
and she admires him.&quot; Mrs. Munro spoke helplessly.
Then she reached behind her and took
from a small table a silver-framed photograph of
a man in uniform--just the head and shoulders--a
stern, handsome face, with close-cropped grey
hair and grave, keen eyes.</p>

<p class="indent">Mrs. Greaves regarded it intently. &quot;He has
grown better-looking with age,&quot; she remarked.
&quot;He looks like an elderly hero in a play. I dare
say he might take a young girl's fancy.&quot; As she
handed the photograph back to Ellen Munro she
espied another photograph on the table, that of a
young man, cheerful, impudent, boyish.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What will Guy say when he hears of Trixie's
engagement, I wonder?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What should he say? There was nothing between
him and Trixie, and never could have been.
They both knew that quite well.&quot;<span class="pagenum"><a name="page104" id="page104"></a>[pg&nbsp;104]</span>
&quot;All the same, it is fortunate, perhaps, that she
is not going to India.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But she <i>is</i> going to India,&quot; said Mrs. Munro
desperately. &quot;George takes up command of that
battalion next month, and he wants Trixie to be
ready to go with him. She is quite willing.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Ah!&quot; exclaimed Mrs. Greaves significantly;
and Trixie's mother sat silent, in rueful understanding.</p>

<p class="indent">Guy Greaves, Colonel Greaves's nephew, was
a subaltern in the battalion of the Barchesters now
serving in India, and it was through him, indirectly,
that Trixie had met the man she had
promised to marry. Some people might have imagined
that she was more likely to marry the
subaltern than the colonel, until that youth left
England, glum and miserable; and there was one
young man the less to go with Trixie and her
friends to teas and dances and theatres--outings
he could ill afford, &quot;broke,&quot; as he had always
declared himself, &quot;to the world.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Presently Mrs. Munro said: &quot;What could I
do, except refuse my consent until Trixie was of
age? Of course, I had to consent. I felt I had
no right to raise objections that could only be
indefinite. As you know, we have nothing but
our pensions, and it is a galling life to a girl of
Trixie's temperament. Colonel Coventry has
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page105" id="page105"></a>[pg&nbsp;105]</span>
private means, and his character is unimpeachable.
There are no drawbacks beyond his age and his
sad story.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Mrs. Munro's voice trembled; she was almost
at the end of her endurance, and she began to
cry in the silent, helpless manner peculiar to
women of her down-trodden type. All her life
she had been sacrificed to somebody; first to her
brother, who had been considered in every way
before herself; then to her husband's mother and
sisters, since the greater part of Mr. Munro's pay
had gone home towards their support, and he had
died before he could save anything for his wife
and child; and then to Trixie, who had always had
what she wanted as far as the widow's slender
means would permit, and of late had been &quot;such
a handful,&quot; to quote Mrs. Greaves and various
other of the mother's old friends.</p>

<p class="indent">The heart of Marion Greaves smote her. She
had a genuine affection for Ellen Munro--the
affection that is born of custom and propinquity.
They had known each other for so many years,
and had been through so much together, and
having no daughter of her own Marion was
deeply, if tiresomely, interested in Ellen's only
girl. As Trixie's godmother she felt doubly entitled
to speak her mind on the subject of Trixie's
faults. She never hesitated to tell the girl she was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page106" id="page106"></a>[pg&nbsp;106]</span>
vain and selfish and rebellious; that, though it
might be true she dusted the drawing-room and
darned her own stockings, she ought also to darn
her mother's, and help in the kitchen and bedrooms
as well, not to speak of making some sort
of attempt to keep down current expenses, instead
of straining her mother's income to breaking point
with her gaieties and her clothes.</p>

<p class="indent">Unknown to Trixie, Mrs. Greaves had more
than once helped Ellen through a difficulty with
a so-called loan, which was afterwards transformed
into a Christmas or a birthday present, despite
Mrs. Munro's grateful protests; and if, in return,
Marion claimed the right to say what she thought,
Mrs. Munro felt that the least she could do was
to submit amiably to the raps of home truths.
Trixie, however, was not so accommodating, and
when Mrs. Greaves was expected to tea she generally
contrived to have a pressing engagement elsewhere.
Even the miserable weather to-day had
not inclined her to listen to her mother's supplications
that she should stay at home for once to
see &quot;Gommie.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I have some regard for my nose,&quot; she had
declared, &quot;and I should certainly get it bitten
off altogether if I gave Gommie the chance this
afternoon.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Now, while Ellen Munro wept, Marion Greaves
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page107" id="page107"></a>[pg&nbsp;107]</span>
put more coal on the fire and stirred up a cheerful
blaze. She also pulled down the blinds and drew
the curtains.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;There,&quot; she said, &quot;that's better. Have some
more tea, Ellen,&quot; she added remorsefully, &quot;and
don't mind what I say. I know as well as you do
that there's no real harm in the child. It's only
a question if George Coventry will realise it when
she is his wife, and make allowances for her youth
and high spirits. If he manages her judiciously,
I don't doubt that she will respond, for I must
own that, with all her faults, the child has an honest
nature. After all, you have done what seems to
you best, and nobody can do more. They must
take their chance of understanding each other.
Only you ought to give Trixie a <i>good</i> talking to
before she goes out to India.&quot; Mrs. Greaves felt
torn between sympathy for Ellen and apprehension
for Trixie's future. &quot;Now, what about the trousseau?
Of course, she gets a sum down for that
from the fund, which is a comfort, and I will give
her a cheque to get what she likes as my wedding
present.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Mrs. Munro's affectionate expressions of gratitude
were muffled by her pocket handkerchief, but
she soon allowed herself to be drawn into an
interesting discussion concerning Trixie's outfit
for India, though both ladies were well aware that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page108" id="page108"></a>[pg&nbsp;108]</span>
they were not likely to be allowed much say in
the matter.</p>

<p class="indent">Covertly Mrs. Greaves glanced at the clock. If
she left at once she would be home in good time
for dinner; if she stayed a little longer she would
miss the next train, but she might see Trixie.
Mrs. Munro was oblivious of the time; she was
looking happier, more alive, and she described the
engagement ring which George had brought in
his pocket yesterday. Such lovely diamonds; and
he was going to give Trixie a pendant, and all
sorts of other delightful things.</p>

<p class="indent">Mrs. Greaves very nearly said: &quot;I wonder what
became of his presents to the first Mrs. Coventry?&quot;
but she refrained, and the next moment the door
was opened and Trixie came in, followed by
Colonel Coventry.</p>

<p class="indent">Even &quot;Gommie&quot; was struck silent by the girl's
beauty. She looked so vivid, so radiant, fresh
from the cold and the wet outside, though her hat
was crammed on to her neck, which raised the ire
of Mrs. Greaves.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Such shocking style!&quot; she commented inwardly.
Then she looked beyond Trixie to the
man who was to be the girl's husband, and found
herself forced to admit that, despite the difference
in their ages, they made a handsome and unusual
pair. Colonel Coventry was obviously devoted,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page109" id="page109"></a>[pg&nbsp;109]</span>
and Trixie looked elated. She introduced
&quot;George&quot; to &quot;Gommie&quot; with scarcely concealed
pride and triumph.</p>

<p class="indent">A shadow crossed the man's face when Mrs.
Greaves claimed him as an old acquaintance.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I remember you very well,&quot; she said, &quot;years
ago in India. You have not been back there since
those days, have you?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No,&quot; he answered shortly.</p>

<p class="indent">Mrs. Munro fluttered to the rescue. &quot;Mrs.
Greaves's nephew, Guy Greaves, is in your regiment,
you know, George. It was through him,
somehow, that you came across Trixie, wasn't it?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I believe I owe him that debt,&quot; he said,
smiling; &quot;and no doubt I shall be expected to
remember it when he wants leave out of his turn.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">They all laughed rather artificially, and Mrs.
Greaves remarked how curious it was that most
people who had been in India found themselves
linked up in some way or another.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Your future mother-in-law and I are such very
old friends, and now you are going to marry my
goddaughter, and there is Guy in your regiment.
It all goes round in a circle.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Then she looked at the clock. &quot;Well, I must
be going, or I shall miss my train. Trixie, my
dear, I hope you will be very happy and that you
will try to be a good wife.&quot;<span class="pagenum"><a name="page110" id="page110"></a>[pg&nbsp;110]</span>
&quot;Oh, Gommie, don't be so depressing. Do
say for a change that you hope George will make
a good husband. That is much more to the point.
How could I be happy if he should turn out to
be a tyrant, and beat and ill-use me? You know,
they say it doesn't matter who you marry, because
you are sure to find out afterwards that you have
married somebody else.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Mrs. Greaves, regarding her with godmotherly
affection, as well as with disapproval, thought of
the night at the railway station in India, such
years ago, when Trixie had laughed and chattered
and danced up and down at the window of the
compartment, grabbing her toy, while her parents
were breaking their hearts in farewell. Then she
was only a baby and could not be blamed for her
callousness; yet now at nineteen she seemed almost
as heartless!</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I am sure,&quot; said Mrs. Greaves dryly, &quot;that it
will be your own fault if he does beat you, and
that you will richly deserve it.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Help!&quot; cried Trixie.</p>

<p class="indent">Mrs. Greaves addressed herself to Mrs. Munro.
&quot;Now, Ellen, may I go into the kitchen and put
on my own shoes and stockings? They must have
been dry long ago. I only trust your maid has
not allowed them to scorch.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The two ladies left the room, and Trixie looked
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page111" id="page111"></a>[pg&nbsp;111]</span>
at herself appreciatively in the mirror over the
mantelpiece and hummed a gay tune.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Gommie is a cat,&quot; she said carelessly. &quot;She
thinks I am a sort of she-devil, and I am sure she
was longing to tell you dreadful things about my
frivolity, and want of heart, and my general
wickedness.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">There was no response, and she turned to
see George Coventry regarding her with serious
eyes.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Perhaps she would also tell you that I was
hard, and cold, and intolerant,&quot; he said brusquely.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well, if you are I shall come home again, and
enjoy myself as a grass widow,&quot; she laughed.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Trixie!&quot; he protested; and her youth, her
sweetness, her bright eyes overcame him, rendered
him weak and fatuous. He caught her in his
arms and kissed her passionately; she submitted
with a sort of gracious triumph. He released her
reluctantly. &quot;I wonder,&quot; he said, &quot;if I am doing
wrong in taking you? My life is half over, yours
is only just beginning. You have no experience,
and mine has been a hard one. Do you know,
child, that I swore I would never believe in a
woman again? And then you came and conquered,
and made me feel I had everything left
to live for if you would be my wife. Trixie&quot;--his
voice held an agony of doubt--&quot;you won't fail
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page112" id="page112"></a>[pg&nbsp;112]</span>
me? You will keep alive my new-found faith?
You will be a true and loving wife?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">She quailed a little at his vehemence, as though
she had a sudden glimpse of something far more
deep and serious than had yet come within her
knowledge.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I will try,&quot; she faltered, half-frightened. Then
her gay spirit reasserted itself. &quot;But you are not
going to expect me to stay at home and mend your
socks and sew on your buttons the <i>whole</i> time,
are you? I may go to dances, and join in theatricals,
and ride, and play tennis, and enjoy myself
now and then, mayn't I?&quot; She looked at him
mischievously.</p>

<p class="indent">He sighed rather hopelessly. &quot;I'm too old for
you, Trixie. I don't dance, and I can't act, though
I certainly can ride and play tennis. I must confess
I prefer staying at home to going out in the
evening, though it will be a different matter now,
altogether, going out with you.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, you shan't be dragged forth when you
don't want to go,&quot; she said, with mock encouragement.
&quot;Guy Greaves can always take me if you
don't feel inclined to turn out. I've known Guy
since we were both children. He's a dear boy,
and he does dance so well. He had tango lessons
when he was at home last summer, and he picked
it up at once.&quot;<span class="pagenum"><a name="page113" id="page113"></a>[pg&nbsp;113]</span>
George Coventry's face darkened. &quot;No other
man will take you out while <i>I</i> am your husband!&quot;
he said violently.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, George, are you going to be jealous?&quot;
she cried in genuine consternation.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I shall not be jealous unless you give me
cause,&quot; he said heatedly. &quot;But I have no intention
of playing the rôle of the complaisant husband, if
that is what you mean.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, don't look so horrid and ogreish. If you
can't trust me, you had better say so at once. If
you imagine I am capable of doing anything that
isn't cricket, we'd better agree to end our engagement.
But I thought&quot;--her voice broke and tears
rose in her eyes--&quot;I thought you really cared for
me, and wanted me to be your wife and not your
slave.&quot; She turned from him to conceal her tearful
annoyance and agitation.</p>

<p class="indent">Instantly he was all remorse and repentance.
&quot;What a brute I am! Trixie, darling, do try to
understand. It's only because I love you so
deeply, so truly, that I can't bear to think of
your having even a pleasure that I can't share
with you. I want all of you, Trixie, all your
confidence and your thoughts, and your moods
and your companionship. My life would be impossible
now without you.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">She responded generously. &quot;I know you didn't
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page114" id="page114"></a>[pg&nbsp;114]</span>
mean to be beastly,&quot; she said, smiling her forgiveness
at him. &quot;You must take me as I am or leave
me. And don't forget that I am taking you as
you are, too, cross old patch.&quot; She gave him a
flippant little kiss on his chin.</p>

<p class="indent">Then, with an exclamation of surprise and
pleasure, she noticed the paper cone filled with
violets that had been left on a chair and forgotten
by her mother and Mrs. Greaves in the engrossment
of their converse.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, delicious things!&quot; She took them up
and smelt them, then held them out to Colonel
Coventry. &quot;How sweet they are! Don't you
love violets? Do violets grow in India, George?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">He recoiled from the fragrance as though it
were some poisonous odour.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I can't endure them,&quot; he said shortly.</p>

<hr />

<p class="indent">Meanwhile, Mrs. Greaves was on her way, in
the rain and the wind, to the station. &quot;If history
doesn't repeat itself,&quot; she was reflecting in anxious
forebodement, &quot;I shall be very thankful, but very
much surprised.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">When she got home she informed her husband
that Ellen Munro was even a greater fool than she
had always believed her to be.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What has she been doing now?&quot; he inquired,
without particular interest.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page115" id="page115"></a>[pg&nbsp;115]</span>
&quot;She has allowed Trixie to get engaged to that
Coventry man we knew a hundred years ago in
India. He is old enough to be her father, and he
divorced his wife for nothing, and never bothered
himself afterwards as to what became of her when
the other man didn't marry her.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Coventry? But he wasn't at all a bad sort of
fellow!&quot; said Colonel Greaves. &quot;As straight as
they make 'em, and such a good shot, if that is
the man you mean. I remember his wife. Now
<i>she</i> was a fool, if you like; he was far too good
for her.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You men always stick up for each other,&quot;
protested his wife. &quot;No doubt you are as ready
to praise that horrible man who ruined poor Mrs.
Coventry's life. I can't remember his name at this
moment.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Colonel Greaves wisely made no reply.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VIII" id="CHAPTER_VIII"></a>CHAPTER VIII</h2>

<p class="h2a">INDIA</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Up</span> country in India spring is a period of conflicting
impressions. The sharp--sometimes almost
too sharp--bite of the cold season has yielded to
a warm and languorous atmosphere, perfumed
powerfully with mango blossom; dew still beads
the grass at dawn; English flowers luxuriate, impelled
to rarer bloom and fragrance. There comes
a sense of ease and peace, and scented calm, that
would be blissful but for the lurking knowledge
that the sun is only just withholding the full
fierceness of his power--giving &quot;quarter,&quot; as it
were--till preparations are complete to resist the
trials of the true hot weather. Fans and punkahs
must be fixed and hung, mosquito curtains washed
and mended, screens of sweet kus-kus root made
ready for the doorways, supplies of captive quail
and teal laid in to tempt the jaded palate, when
all day long the hot west wind would scorch and
shrivel everything outside the darkened houses,
and the temperature might stand as high at
midnight as at noon.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page117" id="page117"></a>[pg&nbsp;117]</span>
At Patalpur the winter gaieties were over, and
the bustle of departure to the hills had just
begun. A feeling of temporary leisure pervaded
the English quarter of the station, and Trixie
Coventry could enjoy the pleasant interval the more
because the drawbacks of the coming months were
yet unknown to her. India was perfect. How she
loved the sun, the space, the colour, the friendliness,
and the novelty of her surroundings! Since
her arrival she had revelled in a whirl of popularity;
no one's party was complete without pretty
Mrs. Coventry; her beauty, her high spirits, and
the fact of her youth, contrasted with her position
as a colonel's wife, made her exceptionally interesting.
One or two &quot;croakers&quot; prophesied that it
would surely turn her head, but the majority could
not pay her too much attention.</p>

<p class="indent">Colonel Coventry bore it all with a fairly
tolerant spirit. His work had been heavy, his
leisure filled with unavoidable engagements that
he recognised were multiplied tenfold because of
his wife's perfections. He attended dinners,
dances, at homes, but all the while he was covertly
impatient for the lull to come, when he and Trixie
might be more alone together, when she would
settle down, of course, to months of domestic
routine. With a certain relief he had observed
that, so far, Trixie had given little time to the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page118" id="page118"></a>[pg&nbsp;118]</span>
renewal of her boy-and-girl friendship with Guy
Greaves, who seemed to have no special footing in
her favour; and, indeed, Colonel Coventry found
nothing to complain of in his wife's attitude towards
any of her numerous admirers. She was
indiscriminately gracious to them all, riding with
one and the other, dancing with each in turn,
laughing, chaffing, accepting their notes and offerings
and adoration with a gay indifference that was
unquestionably beyond criticism or gossip.</p>

<p class="indent">But now that his duties were slackening, now
that he had more leisure to devote to his young
wife, Colonel Coventry began to notice that he
seldom had first claim on her companionship. She
was so frequently engaged for rides, and for sets
of tennis that she declared had &quot;been made up ages
ago, and could not possibly be chucked.&quot; And
gradually Guy Greaves seemed to be more often
her partner, and to be under promise to escort her
on so many riding expeditions. To Colonel
Coventry the young man now appeared to haunt
the veranda, to be always either calling for Mrs.
Coventry, or to have &quot;just brought her back&quot; from
something. Inevitably, dissatisfaction began to
creep into the husband's heart. He was not exactly
jealous--that, he told himself, would be absurd.
Trixie was so frank and open, and so clearly unconscious
that she was doing anything to which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page119" id="page119"></a>[pg&nbsp;119]</span>
anyone could take exception. Greaves was a mere
boy, and, moreover, one of his own subalterns;
and these facts deterred George Coventry from
voicing his disapproval quite so soon as otherwise
he might have done.</p>

<p class="indent">This evening he stood in the veranda of his
bungalow waiting for Trixie to come home. Some
regimental complication had called him away unexpectedly
after luncheon, and he had forgotten
to inquire before he started as to her plans for
the afternoon. Therefore he had hurried back,
intending to suggest a ride, but the bearer informed
him she had already gone out with &quot;Grivsahib.&quot;
They had driven away in the sahib's
dog-cart half an hour ago. Coventry, in his annoyance,
imagined that the man's eyes held a
veiled insolence, and the little rasp of irritation
that had worried him of late increased now to
definite displeasure with his wife. He went off to
play racquets violently; then, calm and more controlled,
he had returned, rather late, only to find
that Trixie had not yet come back. His anger
rose again, but when he had changed for dinner
fear also beset him lest some harm had come to
her, and it urged him out to the veranda.</p>

<p class="indent">Darkness, that in the East drops like a curtain,
shrouded the compound; fireflies were sparkling in
the trees, there was a smell of hot dust and tired
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page120" id="page120"></a>[pg&nbsp;120]</span>
blossoms in the warm, still air that seemed to hold
no sound. He waited, anxious, angry, on the
steps, listening intently for the roll of wheels and
the beat of a pony's hoofs on the hard road. Once
or twice he thought he heard the sounds he expected,
but they died away without coming nearer,
if they had really been audible at all; and then,
as he waited and listened, there rose sharply,
cruelly, in his mind the memory of another night
in India, many years ago, when, from another
bungalow, in another station, he had heard the
rattle of a dog-cart driving swiftly into the adjoining
compound. He became conscious of the scent
of violets. In desperate resentment he moved
forward to try and free himself from this spell of
hideous recollection, and as he moved his foot
struck against a flower-pot. He realised then that
it was a pot of violets, and viciously he kicked it
over the plinth of the veranda, and heard it smash
to pieces as it fell.</p>

<p class="indent">The next moment Trixie and young Greaves
drove in at the compound gate, laughing, and
Trixie called out as the trap drew up before the
steps: &quot;Did you think we were lost, George?&quot;
She sprang lightly to the ground before he could
descend to help her. &quot;We <i>are</i> late, but we've had
a lovely time. Won't you come in, Guy, and have
a drink?&quot;<span class="pagenum"><a name="page121" id="page121"></a>[pg&nbsp;121]</span>
&quot;Not to-night, thanks.&quot; Then the boyish voice
was raised in respectful apology: &quot;So sorry, sir,
but we couldn't help it. Mrs. Coventry will
explain.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Trixie stood by her husband's side as the
dog-cart turned to leave the compound, and she
called after the retreating vehicle: &quot;Don't forget
the first time there's a moon!&quot; And an answering
shout came back: &quot;All right! Good-night!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">She laid her hand on Coventry's arm. &quot;You
haven't been fidgeting, have you, George?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">There was no answer. He stood rigid, unresponsive.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What's the matter? Are you cross?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I thought something must have happened to
you,&quot; he said stiffly.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Why, what could have happened? I was
quite safe with Guy.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Mr. Greaves,&quot; he corrected.</p>

<p class="indent">She laughed. &quot;What nonsense! I've always
called him Guy. Why should I begin 'mister-ing'
him now? Come along in; I'm so hungry.&quot; She
chattered on happily. &quot;We went on the river and
rowed for miles. It was simply lovely. We saw
crocodiles, and a funeral pyre on the bank, with
the relations all standing round and the smoke
curling up. And then we landed and got into a
grove full of tombstones. Guy said he believed it
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page122" id="page122"></a>[pg&nbsp;122]</span>
was an old Mohammedan burying-ground. So
funny, with Hindu corpses being burnt just below
it. What a mixed-up place India seems to be!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What made you so late?&quot; he asked, following
her into the drawing-room, that was bright
and pretty with lamplight and wedding presents
and chintz-covered chairs, though it felt a little
close and airless.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Poof!&quot; said Trixie. &quot;How hot it is in the
house! Do let us have dinner out of doors.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;We should be smothered with insects,&quot; he
objected. &quot;We can't dine outside without lamps
when there's no moon.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Directly there's a moon,&quot; said Trixie, &quot;I'm
going to ride out with Guy to that wood and
sit on a tombstone and look at the river. And
then we will tango--tango in and out among the
trees.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">She danced a few steps, singing, down the
middle of the room. She looked so gay, so full
of life and health, so pretty in her white silk
blouse cut open at the neck, and her short drill
skirt, and a Panama hat slouched over her forehead,
that Coventry's anger melted to a sad regret.
He had never felt quite sure of her, never certain
that she cared for him; indeed, deep in his heart
he knew that Trixie was yet ignorant of love; and
he was tortured with the half-acknowledged dread
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page123" id="page123"></a>[pg&nbsp;123]</span>
that out of some thoughtless flirtation with another
man there might arise a primal passion that would
wreck his life again and hers. To-night the
memory of Rafella, and the dreadful moment of
their parting, was so uncannily insistent that he
felt as though he stood on the brink of another
crisis--one that would be infinitely worse for him.
He loved Trixie as he had never loved his former
wife--a mature, strong love that held far less of
self, combining almost a paternal feeling with the
deep devotion of a husband. And now it was
poisoned with a helpless, jealous sense of danger
that he could not combat. It came between him
and his desire to behave wisely, warily, with tact
towards her. His innate horror of gossip and
scandal, his latent distrust of her friendship with
young Greaves, added to the lingering influence
of his alarm that some accident had befallen her
to keep her out so late, held him harping on the
question that she had not answered.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You haven't told me why you were so late,&quot;
he said.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, George, how you do bother! I don't
know, except that I suppose we forgot the time,
and then, driving home through the bazaar, we
got into a sort of block--a native procession, a
wedding, or a festival of some kind. There was
a tremendous crowd and such a noise--tom-toms
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page124" id="page124"></a>[pg&nbsp;124]</span>
and horns and torches. We were delayed, I should
think, for quite ten minutes, drawn up at the side
of the street while it passed. Guy got so impatient,
and wanted to barge through the middle of it, but,
of course, I wouldn't let him. We should have
knocked down dozens of people. And, besides,
I was awfully interested and amused. I didn't
want to go on. It never struck me that you might
be anxious.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">She ran into her room to dress for dinner, and
he could hear her singing softly as she moved
about. He resolved to say no more about her
staying out so late to-night alone with young
Greaves. If it happened again he would put down
his foot once and for all. Meanwhile, he would
drop a hint to the boy that his behaviour towards
Mrs. Coventry should be rather more circumspect;
and as to the moonlight expedition that Trixie
seemed to contemplate, it would be time enough
to deal with that if she talked of such a senseless
prank again. Probably she would forget all
about it.</p>

<p class="indent">He made every effort during dinner to be
amiable and entertaining, to avoid any subject that
might lead to disagreement, and Trixie responded
in her happiest mood. Afterwards they sat outside
in the veranda, lazing in their long cane
chairs, talking little, quietly content, until suddenly,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page125" id="page125"></a>[pg&nbsp;125]</span>
from the warm darkness of the compound,
there came a harsh and piercing cry that rose to
an excruciating pitch, then, note by note, sank
back once more to silence.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh! what was that?&quot; she asked, startled.</p>

<p class="indent">But it was nothing more alarming than the
trial song of India's cuckoo, the bird that is no
harbinger of hope and life and all the joys of
spring, as is his Western cousin, but the token
of a time of stress and strain and trial only to be
realised by those who have endured it.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;A brain-fever bird,&quot; he told her. &quot;If I can
see the beggar to-morrow I'll shoot him.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">They listened as the sound rose and fell again,
this time farther off.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;India rather frightens me,&quot; said Trixie, &quot;and
yet I get fits of fascination that make me feel as
if the country had bewitched me. It all seems so
old and so cruel, and yet so alluring. I felt the
spell of it this evening on the river, and still more
strongly when we were waiting in the bazaar for
the procession to pass. That big city, full of
people we really know nothing about, with all
sorts of weird things happening in it that we never
hear of. <i>I</i> think the bazaar is quite wonderful,
but Guy Greaves said the smell of it was all that
affected him, and his one idea was to get out
of it.&quot;<span class="pagenum"><a name="page126" id="page126"></a>[pg&nbsp;126]</span>
&quot;The young fool had no business to take you
through the bazaar at all!&quot; said Coventry, with
suppressed irritation.</p>

<p class="indent">Disapproval invariably spurred Trixie to truculence.
&quot;It was the shortest way,&quot; she retorted
with spirit, &quot;and we were late as it was. How
were we to know that we should be delayed by a
procession?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Coventry did not reply. He had no desire to
embark on further argument with Trixie.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I suppose,&quot; she went on idly, &quot;there are no
end of extraordinary stories buried away all over
India. Do you think it is true that lots of
white women were carried off in the Mutiny
and were never seen again, or only heard of by
accident?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I don't know,&quot; he said, with curt reluctance
to discuss such a subject. &quot;One hears all sorts
of things.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">One thing had been mentioned in his hearing
only this afternoon, on the racquet court, that had
filled him with disgust and horror--a whisper, a
rumour, that a woman, an Englishwoman, was
living in a certain quarter of the bazaar. The
thought sickened him. Pah! it was atrocious, if
true. It recurred to him unpleasantly, increasing
his annoyance that his wife should have been exposed
to the gaze of a crowd of excited natives
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page127" id="page127"></a>[pg&nbsp;127]</span>
in company with a man who was not her husband.
In his opinion, the less Englishwomen were
observed of Orientals the better. His determination
strengthened that in future Trixie should have
no escort but himself.</p>

<p class="indent">He found it easy to carry out his intention for
the time being. Young Greaves was laid low with
an attack of malaria, and afterwards he took a
month's leave to join a rich globe-trotting relative
on a little tour through native states. Trixie seemed
quite content to ride with her husband and to
have him for her partner on the tennis court. He
rode extremely well and looked his best on horseback,
and there were few couples who could hope
to beat the Coventrys at tennis when they played
together. Just then a small and select tournament
was in progress, and Trixie held high hopes that
she and George would win it. She coveted the
prize--a handsome silver chain bag for the lady;
and she meant to annex the cigarette-case as well
that was to reward the victorious male partner.
And George weakly promised she should have it
if they won, though he disapproved entirely of
women smoking, and hated to see Trixie with a
cigarette between her red lips. All the same, it
was a spectacle that had to be endured, for nothing
he could say had yet persuaded Trixie to eschew
the habit. Dances were in abeyance for the next
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page128" id="page128"></a>[pg&nbsp;128]</span>
few months, but there were little friendly dinners,
and it was altogether a pleasant and congenial
period, though daily the heat grew and brain-fever
birds multiplied in the compounds, and people
went out later in the afternoons and earlier in the
mornings.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IX" id="CHAPTER_IX"></a>CHAPTER IX</h2>

<p class="h2a">DOUBT</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Probably</span> Coventry was happier just now than he
had yet been during his lifetime. He had always
known, he assured himself, that, once the first
excitement of her new existence had subsided,
Trixie would settle down; that it could only be
a matter of time for her to realise the responsibilities
of a married woman's life; which self-assurance
was not exactly genuine. But when
doubt has safely turned to confidence, many of us
are apt to forget that doubt has ever troubled us
at all. However, at last Trixie seemed to have
entered upon a stage of domesticity, just as whole-heartedly
as she had thrown herself at first into
gaieties and social distractions. She became wildly
enthusiastic over her housekeeping, and tried her
own and her husband's digestions severely by her
daring experiments in cookery. She started a
farmyard, and was triumphant concerning eggs
and poultry, while George was driven silently
distracted by the piercing and persistent clack of
guinea-fowls. She spent contented hours at her
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page130" id="page130"></a>[pg&nbsp;130]</span>
piano and over her home mail, which, until lately,
she had rather neglected. And she did not complain
of the increasing heat, nor of the compulsory
imprisonment indoors during the long days. She
had plenty of resources within herself, and her
high spirits never flagged. Any idea of going to
the hills apparently had not occurred to her, and
Coventry, whose theory was that as long as she
kept her health a wife's place was with her husband,
prudently did not suggest it. Not that he
would have actually distrusted her away from him,
but his peace of mind must have suffered acutely,
knowing that she was making friendships and
joining in amusements that he could not supervise;
for undoubtedly Trixie would enjoy herself without
reflection wherever she might be, and then there
was always the fear of people talking, which held
a kind of nightmare niche in his imagination.</p>

<p class="indent">It was just at this peaceful period that an invitation
came for him to join the camp of a well-known
sportsman on a tiger-shooting expedition,
an opportunity that no man, however uxorious a
husband--and especially a man like Coventry, with
whom sport had always been a passion--could
easily resist without regret. And yet he hesitated.
He could not honestly feel that he did not want to
go, and yet he could have wished that Markham
had not remembered him, had not thought of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page131" id="page131"></a>[pg&nbsp;131]</span>
giving him this tempting chance, or that the
letter had miscarried on the way and never reached
him.</p>

<p class="indent">When he opened the letter he and Trixie were
seated at their early breakfast in the veranda,
attended by a greedy and devoted gathering of
pets. Two well-disciplined fox terriers watched in
quivering impatience for scraps of toast, obediently
oblivious of a pair of Persian kittens that clawed
and mewed and sprang in unmannerly fashion; a
noisy green parrot in a dome-shaped cage; a
monkey that jumped and jabbered on the back of
the memsahib's chair; a tame squirrel that darted
to and fro with bead-like eyes and feathery tail,
even a greater trial to the dogs than the Persian
kittens. Trixie worshipped animals and children;
indeed, she had one day scandalised the general's
wife by declaring, most immodestly as that lady
considered, that she intended to have twenty
babies, but, meanwhile, she could content herself
with dogs and cats and monkeys.</p>

<p class="indent">Coventry threw the letter across the table to his
wife; he half hoped she would read it with dismay,
and show reluctance that he should accept the
invitation. This, he felt, would give him just the
excuse he wanted to refuse it, would put a definite
obstacle in the way of acceptance instead of his
being left at the mercy of conflicting inclinations.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page132" id="page132"></a>[pg&nbsp;132]</span>
He watched her read the letter, but her expression
did not cloud; on the contrary, it brightened.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, George!&quot; she cried, looking up at him
with shining eyes, &quot;how lovely for you, and how
I wish I could come too! I'd give anything to
ride an elephant all day, and see tigers charge, and
hear them roar, and then wear a necklace of their
claws!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Markham won't have women on his shoots.
He says it degrades the sport to the level of garden
party games!&quot; said Coventry.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, what a pig he must be!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Anyway, it would be far too rough for you,
and the heat would be awful in tents. I'm not at
all sure that I like the idea of it myself.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You surely can't mean that you are dreaming
of refusing?&quot; cried Trixie, in amazed reproach.
&quot;Of course, you must go. He asks you to wire,
so you must answer at once. Shall I get a telegraph
form?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I'm not particularly keen on going,&quot; he said,
with affected carelessness.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I don't believe it! I am sure you are aching
to wire and say you are coming. If you are pretending
that you don't want to go because you
think I shall be lonely, you can put that out of
your head at once. I shan't miss you a bit.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">She in her turn was acting the hypocrite. In
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page133" id="page133"></a>[pg&nbsp;133]</span>
reality her heart had sunk a little as she read the
letter. She knew she should miss George very
much, that she would feel lonely, dull, and rather
helpless without him, and she suddenly recognised
that she leaned on him mentally a good deal more
than she had been aware of hitherto. Also that his
interest in and sympathy with all her little schemes
and undertakings had meant much to her.
Secretly she had been surprised at her own acceptance
of the daily monotony and lack of excitements,
and wondered vaguely why she was not
bored; and now the knowledge came to her with
almost startling effect that it was because of
George's constant presence. She looked at him
with new attention--he was in uniform, for he had
just returned from early parade--and a little glow
of pride in his appearance kindled in her heart.
Certainly she had a very handsome husband, and,
moreover, he was kind and good and faithful, even
if his ideas of propriety were somewhat tedious
and old-maidish, and he was inclined to be jealous
and over-particular. After all, he knew the world;
his experience had been long and wide, and he had
no great reason to trust either men or women.
Trixie seldom thought of the first Mrs. Coventry.
The old story had not troubled her; hardly had she
regarded it as real. The whole of George's past
life was more or less unreal to her, for the reason,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page134" id="page134"></a>[pg&nbsp;134]</span>
perhaps, that he had never spoken of more than
casual happenings, or small reminiscences connected
with his mother, now dead, and his sister,
who had taken up missionary work in the slums of
London.</p>

<p class="indent">In addition, Trixie was a person who contemplated
the present and the immediate future to
the exclusion of retrospection, partly because she
was so young and had all her life before her, and
again because it was her nature. She neither
looked back nor far forward. Yet now a glimmering
of what her husband might have suffered in
the past disturbed her self-engrossment, and caused
her to feel inadequate and humble, possessed with
a helpless regret that drove her to an unselfish
desire to conceal her own feelings over this question
of his absence. Her apparent anxiety that he
should accept Mr. Markham's invitation was construed
by Coventry to mean that she was more or
less unaffected by the prospect of his absence, and,
half hurt and half resentful, he said a little
captiously:</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well, if you want to get rid of me, of course
I'll go.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You know very well you are dying to go,&quot;
answered Trixie, with good humour; &quot;and it will
do you good. All these years at home you've
only been able to shoot pheasants and rabbits
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page135" id="page135"></a>[pg&nbsp;135]</span>
and little birds; and what are they compared with
tigers?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It's much more difficult to shoot a snipe than
a tiger,&quot; argued Coventry perversely.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;All the better. You'll be able to bring me
back several dozen skins, and heaps of claws,
and plenty of those funny little bones that make
into brooches and are supposed to bring such good
luck.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;How did you know about the bones?&quot; he
asked, rather to delay the making of a decision at
the moment than because he wished to hear.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Mother has one--not that it ever brought her
any luck, poor dear, unless it was getting me
married; and I suppose Gommie, at any rate,
would call that good luck! Guy Greaves told me
about the bones, too, and he's going to give me
one when he shoots his first tiger. He was to have
come back yesterday, wasn't he? Was he on
parade this morning?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes,&quot; said Coventry.</p>

<p class="indent">The sudden mention at this juncture of young
Greaves made Coventry's heart contract with a
spasm of jealous apprehension.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I hope,&quot; he said, with injudicious haste, &quot;that,
if I do go on this shoot, you won't let that boy
hang round the bungalow and follow you about
all over the place while I am away.&quot;<span class="pagenum"><a name="page136" id="page136"></a>[pg&nbsp;136]</span>
Trixie flushed. &quot;So that is why you hesitated
about going?&quot; she asked him ominously. &quot;Perhaps
you would like me to say 'Not at home' to
visitors and refuse every invitation while you are
not here?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Trixie, don't be foolish!&quot; He regretted
having voiced his feelings. It had put him in a
false position. Now he must either accept the
invitation, or refuse it and remain under the suspicion
that he would not leave his wife because
he feared he could not trust her to behave becomingly.
&quot;Of course, I know you would not do
anything really wrong, but you are so careless
about appearances, and people don't take circumstances
into consideration. Why should they?
They wouldn't know or remember that you have
known Greaves nearly all your life. They would
only say that he was in love with you, and that
you were encouraging him. You can't be too careful
in India, where we all know each other, and
live, so to speak, on the house-tops.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Then you wouldn't mind how much I went
about with Guy so long as nobody was any the
wiser?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes, of course I should; but I naturally should
not put the same construction on it that people
would who did not know you.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Perhaps you had better not go, then,&quot; said
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page137" id="page137"></a>[pg&nbsp;137]</span>
Trixie sweetly; and she began to play with the
monkey and pet the kittens, and throw scraps to
the dogs. Then she rose, flourishing a bunch of
keys. &quot;I must go and fight with the cook,&quot; she
announced. &quot;His bill for charcoal is preposterous.
The other women tell me we use four times what
we ought--or pay for it, at any rate--and, of
course, that won't do, will it, George?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">He ignored the appeal, and with ostentatious
indifference she strolled into the house, jingling
her keys. The dogs followed her, and Coventry
sat in moody perplexity, remorseful, heavy hearted.
The kittens began to clamber all over the table,
the monkey helped himself from the sugar-basin,
and the parrot rent the air with jealous abuse in
Hindustani. Oblivious to it all, Coventry lit a
cigarette and stared out at the dry compound. He
was reflecting that he ought not to have married
again at his age and with his temperament--or
that at least he should have chosen a sedate and
serious spinster, if not some gentle widow, who
would have caused him no anxiety, no heart disturbance,
as did Trixie--one whom he could have
left without a qualm for any call of pleasure or of
duty. And Trixie was to be pitied. She might
have been far happier with a young husband as
gay and heedless, and as irresponsible, as herself.
They would have gained their experiences, have
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page138" id="page138"></a>[pg&nbsp;138]</span>
&quot;worried through&quot; together, come out none the
worse for ups and downs and disagreements,
having the same outlook on life, and with youth
and tastes in common. He wondered if she repented
her marriage, if he bored her, if perchance
she really preferred the company, say, of young
Greaves, to his own? The thought tortured him.
He felt he could not go away and leave her. He
would only be miserable, unable to enjoy himself,
thinking of her all the time, picturing her riding,
driving, laughing with that idiotic boy, while the
station smiled and whispered, amused, yet commiserating
the absent husband.</p>

<p class="indent">Markham's letter had fallen from the table and
lay open at his feet. He picked it up and read it
through again, and the call of the jungle stirred
his blood with unwelcome temptation. It was such
years since he had heard the whisper of an Indian
forest and the hot, dry crackle of tall grass, since
he had swayed on the back of an elephant, alert
and ready for the sight of a great striped beast,
and known the fierce excitement of &quot;sitting up&quot;
over a &quot;kill,&quot; waiting breathless, motionless, for
the first faint sound of a stealthy tread.</p>

<p class="indent">Trixie came back. She slapped the kittens and
scolded the monkey, and then looked over George's
shoulder.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well,&quot; she said cheerfully, &quot;have you made
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page139" id="page139"></a>[pg&nbsp;139]</span>
up your mind? If you're going, you ought to
overhaul your guns and rifles without any delay.
You'd have to start in a day or two. You see,
he says the 15th at the latest.&quot; She pointed with
a pink, tapering finger to a paragraph in the letter.</p>

<p class="indent">He moved restlessly. &quot;I must think it over,&quot;
he said, with some irritation.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;All right. But you can't keep Mr. Markham
waiting indefinitely for your answer. There are
hundreds of men who would give their eyes and
ears and noses for the invitation. I only wish
I could dress up as a man, and stick on a moustache,
and go instead of you.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Anger seized him, engendered by his mingled
feelings of reluctance and desire to take advantage
of the chance.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Hang!&quot; he exclaimed, rising to his feet. &quot;I'll
go, and take the consequences.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What consequences?&quot; asked Trixie. &quot;George,
you weren't really serious when you talked about
Guy Greaves just now? You don't really think
you couldn't leave me for a fortnight in case I
should get into mischief, and do something that
would make you and me seem ridiculous?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You don't understand,&quot; he argued hotly.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Then will you explain?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I have tried to, but you can't see my point
of view. It isn't that I don't trust you, Trixie;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page140" id="page140"></a>[pg&nbsp;140]</span>
I know you don't mean any harm; but if you make
yourself conspicuous with other men you can't
expect people not to talk and think the worst, and
I can't bear that you should be a subject for
scandal.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But why should you imagine I am going to
give anybody cause to talk directly your back is
turned? I should do nothing while you are away
that I wouldn't do while you are here.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;That's just it!&quot; he said, with some excitement.
&quot;If you ride and drive all over the place
with young Greaves, and let him come and sit here
for hours, as you did before he went on leave, there
is bound to be gossip.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But <i>you</i> know that there's nothing in it,&quot; she
argued plaintively. &quot;You have said so. Isn't
that enough?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Then her heart smote her. She knew she was
teasing him, making it more difficult for him to
go away with a light heart to enjoy the shoot; and
while she considered his attitude absurd, she made
up her mind she would humour his scruples and
sink her own opinion in favour of the circumstances.
Poor dear old George! He was such a
prude, so dog-in-the-mangerish, so prone to make
a silly fuss about nothing. Yet, if it really worried
him to think that she and Guy might lead people
to imagine they were lovers, she would give in to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page141" id="page141"></a>[pg&nbsp;141]</span>
him and promise anything he liked. She wanted
him to have some pleasure; she was conscious that
her notions of enjoyment were not his, and she felt
it would be more than &quot;beastly&quot;--to use her own
term--not to help him now to get off on this tiger
shoot with a mind at ease.</p>

<p class="indent">She came round the table and perched herself
on his knee, winding a soft arm about his neck.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Will it make you happy, old George, if I
promise not to go out with Guy while you are
away, and not to let him come here when I am
alone?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">He pressed her to him in fond compunction,
overwhelmed with tender feeling for her, recognising
gladly the generous impulse that had prompted
her concession.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Darling, I don't ask you to promise anything.
I only want you to remember that you are a married
woman, and to guard your name and reputation
as something sacred. You have only to think
a little, and not expect other people to be as charitable
and unsuspicious of evil as you are yourself.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">She kissed him lightly on the forehead. &quot;I
will think and remember the whole time,&quot; she reassured
him. &quot;You needn't feel one bit afraid. I
shall have heaps to do without bothering about
men. I'm going to hem dozens of dusters, and
the Padre's wife has promised to teach me no end
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page142" id="page142"></a>[pg&nbsp;142]</span>
of cooking, so I shall keep her to her word. You'll
be back before I can turn round.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;How can I leave you?&quot; he said, with passionate
reluctance.</p>

<p class="indent">She laid on the breakfast-table a piece of paper
she had brought from the bungalow.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Here's a telegraph form,&quot; she announced
cheerily, &quot;and my fountain-pen. I'm going to
write out the wire for you. What shall I say?&quot;
She shifted her position and began to trace the
words: &quot;'Accept with many thanks starting soon
as possible.' How's that?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well,&quot; he said grudgingly, &quot;I suppose I'd
better go.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You <i>are</i> going,&quot; Trixie told him; &quot;and when
you are there you will bless your wife for making
you go.&quot; She referred to Markham's letter and
added the address. Then she rose and summoned
with a call a lurking orderly, and gave him the
form, with some money hitherto secreted in the
palm of her hand. &quot;Take that to the post office,&quot;
she commanded him in halting Hindustani.</p>

<p class="indent">In silence they watched the man leave the compound
with alert, important progress, and Coventry
gave a sigh of resignation.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You young bully!&quot; he said in mock reproach.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You old idiot!&quot; she retorted, laughing, and
bustled back to grapple with her housekeeping.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_X" id="CHAPTER_X"></a>CHAPTER X</h2>

<p class="h2a">THE RIVER</p>

<p><span class="smcap">After</span> that there followed a period of unusual
activity in the Coventry's bungalow. Guns and
rifles were overhauled, ammunition ordered, boxes
and cupboards were ransacked for garments suited
to the jungle.</p>

<p class="indent">Trixie entered keenly into all the preparations.
She seldom did anything by halves; and she might
almost have been joining in the expedition herself
so lively was her interest in every detail. She
asked endless questions concerning camps and
elephants and tigers, and she listened breathless
to all that George could tell her of the fascinations
of the jungle. She dragged books on sport from
the musty shelves of the club library, and read
them with genuine enjoyment during two long,
hot afternoons.</p>

<p class="indent">Coventry to the last was more or less reluctant
to leave her; but she ignored his hesitation, and
when the hour of departure came she drove with
him gaily to the railway station, and with a cheerful,
smiling face saw him off by the night mail.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page144" id="page144"></a>[pg&nbsp;144]</span>
It was when she returned to the empty bungalow
that her spirits sank. The rooms were so
silent, save for the tiny trumpeting of mosquitoes
in the corners; the atmosphere felt so close, and
there was a smell of musk rat that was nauseating.
Until dawn brought comparative coolness she lay
awake, turning restlessly, hearing the desperate
cry of the brain-fever bird, and the monotonous
thrumming of a stringed instrument in the servants'
quarters at the end of the compound. She
wondered if natives ever slept save during the
spell of rest they claimed in the middle of the day,
when a drowsy peace descended everywhere.</p>

<p class="indent">With a sense of dismay that hitherto she had
held in check, she contemplated the coming fortnight.
How boring it would be to have to &quot;think
and remember&quot; the whole time that she must be
careful to give no cause for gossip! True, she
had her household and her livestock, and her linen
and store cupboards to occupy her mornings, and
she could read and sleep through the succeeding
hot hours; but what of the evenings?</p>

<p class="indent">For the first week she got on well enough. She
snubbed Guy Greaves and other eager slaves who
would willingly have placed their time, their dog-carts,
their ponies--everything that they possessed--at
her disposal. She played in &quot;married&quot; sets of
tennis, and dined and consorted with the most
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page145" id="page145"></a>[pg&nbsp;145]</span>
domesticated couples in the station, so nervous was
she of committing any indiscretion. Every day
she wrote to George, accounting for her time; this
she felt to be a sort of safeguard against the least
false step; and so far there had been nothing connected
with her doings that she could not chronicle
with a perfectly clear conscience.</p>

<p class="indent">So the time dragged on until the evening before
the day on which George Coventry was expected
to come home.</p>

<p class="indent">The heat was now terrific; even tennis had
become an effort, and Trixie left the bungalow to
keep her engagement in the public gardens, feeling
listless and oppressed. The hot weather had begun
early this year, there had been no cooling storms
to give temporary coolness and relief, and on all
sides Trixie heard ominous predictions that &quot;the
rains&quot; were going to fail. Not that the prospect
disturbed her particularly, for as yet she could not
realise its gravity. Only those whose lives have
been bound up with India can understand the dread
of such a visitation, the anxious watching of the
sky, the heaviness of heart when meteorological
reports look bad. For a failure, or even a weakness,
of the monsoon means grim combat with
pestilence and famine, and most dire distress, not
only at the time, but afterwards, when fever takes
its toll from an enfeebled population. It means
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page146" id="page146"></a>[pg&nbsp;146]</span>
strain and over-work for the long-suffering official;
everywhere misery, death, and desolation.</p>

<p class="indent">After a languid game she dawdled late at the
club with a group of people who, like herself,
felt unwilling to return to stuffy bungalows and
food that must inevitably prove untempting. To-night
especially she shrank from the prospect of
a solitary dinner and the weary after hours, even
though supported by the knowledge that it was her
last evening alone.</p>

<p class="indent">They all sat outside the club-house on a round
masonry platform, talking fitfully, fanned by a
make-shift punkah slung between two poles.
Gradually two or three married couples bestirred
themselves and drove away; a few unattached men
who had dinner engagements deserted also, and
presently Mrs. Coventry and Mrs. Roy were the
only ladies left, with a small attendance of young
men--Guy Greaves, two other subalterns, and a
home-sick youth who had joined the Civil Service
only last winter, and still preserved pathetically
a Bond Street air.</p>

<p class="indent">Mrs. Roy was young and pretty and light-hearted,
but not entirely without guile. Captain
Roy had gone away that afternoon on duty, and
she did not intend to dine alone. She invited the
company to join her at dinner.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;There's lots of food, such as it is,&quot; she told
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page147" id="page147"></a>[pg&nbsp;147]</span>
them, &quot;and even if we can't eat we can drink
champagne with plenty of ice in it.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I'm afraid I can't come,&quot; said Trixie ruefully.
She knew that George disapproved of Mrs.
Roy.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Why not?&quot; persisted Mrs. Roy. &quot;Who are
you dining with--the missionaries?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">They all laughed.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I'm not dining with anybody,&quot; admitted
Trixie, obviously weakening. She longed to join
the party and have a little &quot;fling,&quot; to laugh and
talk nonsense and be amused, as an antidote to
all her good behaviour. No letter would have to
be written to-morrow to George. She could tell
him all about the evening, and make him understand
that she had meant and done no harm.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Then why can't you come? Don't be unsociable,&quot;
argued Mrs. Roy. &quot;To-morrow we may
all be dead of heat apoplexy, or cholera, or snake-bite,
or something equally common to this delightful
country, and then you'd be sorry you hadn't
enjoyed yourself while you had the chance.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Do say 'Yes,' Mrs. Coventry,&quot; sang a chorus
of male voices. And after a moment's further
hesitation Trixie succumbed.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I must go back and change, then,&quot; she said,
and rose.

A little later they all met again in Mrs. Roy's
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page148" id="page148"></a>[pg&nbsp;148]</span>
pretty bungalow, and despite the heat and the
insects, and, according to Mrs. Roy, the uncertainty
of existence in India, they were a festive
little party. They chaffed and told stories, and
drank iced champagne and smoked cigarettes, and
Trixie cast from her all thoughts of her husband's
displeasure. Until this evening she had conformed
to his wishes with the most strict consideration.
She felt she deserved this innocent enjoyment,
that it would be really unreasonable of George if
he grudged it to her.</p>

<p class="indent">She had honestly intended to go home soon
after dinner was over, but Mrs. Roy refused to
&quot;hear of such a thing.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Behold the moon!&quot; she exclaimed, a good
deal later, as they straggled out into the veranda
after a short and boisterous game of cards.</p>

<p class="indent">And, indeed, the moon was something to behold--huge,
orange-coloured, almost terrifying,
hanging heavy in the dusty night. Its lurid light
filtered through the foliage of the trees and tinged
the haze of the atmosphere with an unearthly
radiance.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I ask you, who could go to bed whilst that
great lantern blazes in the sky?&quot; cried Mrs. Roy
with mock grandiloquence. &quot;Let us all drive
down to the river and go for a row. Wouldn't it
be simply perfect?&quot;<span class="pagenum"><a name="page149" id="page149"></a>[pg&nbsp;149]</span>
And, with others, Trixie agreed. What did
it matter? Who cared? There was a sensuous
influence in the hot, scented air that stilled her
scruples, rendered her reckless. For the moment
all the careless, irresponsible gaiety of her girlhood
had returned.</p>

<p class="indent">The young civilian and one of the subalterns
took charge of Mrs. Roy, the other three climbed
into Guy Greaves's dog-cart, and they all drove
hatless, wrapless, along the deserted, dusty road
hedged with dry mud-banks that were tipped with
prickly pear and cactus, until the ground began
to slope, the wheels of the vehicles sank deep into
the heavy, sandy soil, and they were at the river's
edge.</p>

<p class="indent">There was a little delay while two boats were
got ready by sleepy boatmen roused from their
huts, a good deal of talk and laughter and argument
as to how the party should divide and how
far they should row. Finally it was agreed that
in an hour's time they should land at the grove
of trees that sheltered the Mohammedan cemetery,
and that the syces with the traps, and a man to
take back the boats, should meet them there.</p>

<p class="indent">Trixie found herself afloat alone with Guy
Greaves. She did not know if this was due to
an accident or to Guy's deliberate man&#248;uvring.
She felt as though she were in a dream as she
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page150" id="page150"></a>[pg&nbsp;150]</span>
took the rudder-lines. The second boat shot past
them, and the occupants called out foolish jokes
and gibes, sprinkled them with water, and left
them far behind.</p>

<p class="indent">They slid slowly, silently, over the smooth
bosom of the holy river, that was burnished with
the moonlight. From the distance came the sound
of native singing, a faint sound that rose and fell
on the warm night air, only to be drowned, as
though in protest, by the yells of jackals hunting,
closely packed, across the plain.</p>

<p class="indent">Then all again was quiet, with a vast and
dreamy peace that held the man and woman speechless,
like a spell, as the boat slipped through the
water, on and on.</p>

<p class="indent">Suddenly Guy Greaves stopped rowing. He
leaned towards his companion, his young face set
and hard, his eyes dark in the moonlight; his
hands, holding the oars, were strained and
trembling.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Trixie!&quot; he said in hoarse appeal.</p>

<p class="indent">His voice roused her. She looked at him,
surprised.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Why have you been so cruel to me lately?
What have I done?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">She felt irritated, helpless. &quot;Don't, Guy. Don't
be so silly. I don't know what you mean.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh! I know it's no use. But I must say it;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page151" id="page151"></a>[pg&nbsp;151]</span>
I must tell you.&quot; He spoke with quick, nervous
emotion. &quot;It isn't as if I'd ever done or said anything
since you came out here married to deserve
the way you've sat on me lately--or if I have, I
didn't know it. I thought I'd been so jolly careful!
It hasn't been easy--and it's no good pretending
now that I don't care for you, or for you
to pretend that you don't know it. You knew it
when I was at home last year, and we had such
ripping times together. If only I'd been able to
afford to marry, wouldn't you have taken me--Trixie?
Wouldn't you? Instead of marrying a
man old enough to be your great-grandfather!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The boy had lost his head; his words came
with passionate bitterness.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Guy, be quiet!&quot; Trixie broke in, distressed
and alarmed. &quot;You must be mad to talk like this.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">He paid no heed. &quot;No, I'm not mad--unless,
perhaps, with wretchedness. I could stand it all
as long as you treated me as a pal, and were kind,
and let me do things for you. But you suddenly
kicked me off like an old shoe, and, as far as I
can see, for no reason whatever. I want to know,&quot;
he went on doggedly, &quot;what I've done.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You haven't done anything,&quot; she hastened to
tell him. &quot;It's all your silly imagination. Do,
for goodness' sake, go on rowing; we shall never
catch up the others before they land.&quot;<span class="pagenum"><a name="page152" id="page152"></a>[pg&nbsp;152]</span>
He sat motionless, waiting.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Guy--you <i>must</i> row on. I'll tell you nothing
while you behave like this. It's beastly of you.
Look--we're floating to the other side of the river!
Guy, do be sensible!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">That was what she had said to him last year
at home, when he had &quot;talked nonsense&quot; at a dance
before he had to sail for India. They both remembered
it now. In her agitation she clutched
at the rudder-lines confusedly, and the boat almost
swung round. He steadied it with the oars, but
he did not go on rowing.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Would you have married me if it had been
possible?&quot; he persisted, though now more calmly.</p>

<p class="indent">There was a long pause. The boat moved
sideways, gravitating towards the farther bank,
nearing ridges of sand and islets of brushwood and
rubbish, mysterious shapes that stuck up sharp and
fantastic in the moonlight. Something swished
past, rippling the water with swift cleavage--a
long, black water-snake hurrying to its refuge.
And a mighty splash broke the stillness--a crocodile
disturbed from its stupor on a sandbank.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No,&quot; said Trixie in a low, tense voice, &quot;I
would not have married you. I think I could never
have married anybody but George.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The truth had come to her, here on the river
in the moonlight, with sudden and overpowering
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page153" id="page153"></a>[pg&nbsp;153]</span>
force. She loved her husband, loved him with
all her generous, impulsive heart--and this in spite
of his strict views and old-fashioned opinions, his
tiresome jealousy, his age! And yet at this very
moment she was doing something that, if he could
know of it, would hurt and anger him and shake
his trust in her, destroy all his pleasure in his
holiday, perhaps create a rupture between them
that never could be healed! What a fool she had
been to dine with Mrs. Roy, to allow herself to
be dragged into this idiotic escapade. And here
was Guy behaving like a lunatic because she was
alone with him on the river in the middle of the
night. How could she ever explain it all to George
and persuade him to forgive her?</p>

<p class="indent">Before her mental vision rose her husband's
handsome, careworn face--the keen grey eyes, the
dark hair frosted at the temples; and with it came
remembrance, realisation of all he must have
suffered in the past. How often he had told her
that she had restored to him his trust in womanhood,
had made him happy when all hope of
happiness had seemed denied him.</p>

<p class="indent">In a measure she had failed him, too. He
would be certain to hear of to-night's folly, even
if she told him nothing about it herself. The
only thing to do was to get home as quickly as
possible.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page154" id="page154"></a>[pg&nbsp;154]</span>
Guy Greaves sat opposite to her, obdurate, motionless,
thinking only of himself and his stupid,
boyish adoration, which was nothing compared
with the love of a man experienced and tried. She
felt she hated Guy, and all the superficial view of
life that he represented to her penitent soul.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, go on--go on!&quot; she cried in frightened
desperation. &quot;I must get home. I ought never
to have come. I can't bear it. If you don't row,
I'll never speak to you again.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">He took up the oars with reluctance. She
pulled the rudder-lines again, first one, then the
other. The boat shot crookedly, with a shivering
shock, on to a sandbank, and stuck fast.

Young Greaves said &quot;Damn!&quot; and Trixie
screamed. She stood up.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;For God's sake sit down!&quot; implored Guy, in
fear that she might spring from the boat, a hideous
thought of lurking crocodiles flashing through his
mind.</p>

<p class="indent">She sank back to her seat, mute, apprehensive,
while he tried vainly to refloat the boat.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Give me an oar. Let me help,&quot; she said. He
passed it to her. They used all their strength
without avail.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Shout!&quot; she ordered him. &quot;The others may
hear you and come back.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">He obeyed her, and the sound echoed wide and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page155" id="page155"></a>[pg&nbsp;155]</span>
far across the water. But the only answer was the
hooting of an owl in some bushes on the bank, and
the scrambling of some startled little creature near
them in the sand.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;We shall be here all night!&quot; she cried,
despairing.</p>

<p class="indent">He did not answer. All his attention was
concentrated on his efforts to release the boat.</p>

<p class="indent">Actually how long it stuck there neither of them
knew. The moon sank lower, glowing, molten;
myriads of mosquitoes beat about them, bit their
faces, hands, and feet; the river seemed as stagnant
as a pool.</p>

<p class="indent">Trixie felt paralysed, as in a nightmare. What
if they were kept prisoners till the dawn--even
longer--even till George should have returned to
the bungalow and found her absent?</p>

<p class="indent">All at once, with a lurch, the boat shot free,
and Trixie burst into tears of relief.</p>

<p class="indent">Guy Greaves felt almost hysterical himself.
&quot;It's all right now, Trixie. Don't cry.&quot; He spoke
with cheerful reassurance. &quot;I'll row hard, and we
shall catch the others up in no time.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;They must have landed long ago,&quot; she
quavered. &quot;Can't we go back to the starting-place?
It must be nearer.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But the traps were to meet us at the grove,&quot;
he reminded her. &quot;We should have to walk all
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page156" id="page156"></a>[pg&nbsp;156]</span>
the way home if we went back, and that would
take ever so much longer.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Supposing the others haven't waited,&quot; she
suggested nervously. &quot;It would be just like them.
They can't all get into the same trap, and they'd
take yours and leave us to fish for ourselves without
caring twopence!&quot; Her agitation rendered
her petulant and pessimistic. &quot;You know how
thoughtless and inconsiderate Mrs. Roy can be.
That is why George can't bear her.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, nonsense! Mrs. Roy's dog-cart holds
four at a pinch, if they let the syce follow. Even if
they did take my trap, they'd send it back to meet
us. Anyway, don't worry about that till we get
there.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">He rowed harder than ever, infected in spite
of himself by Trixie's forebodings; and he felt
hardly surprised to see only the boatman awaiting
them on the rough little landing-stage.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What did I tell you!&quot; said Trixie, a catch
of despair in her voice.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;They wouldn't wait down here,&quot; he said,
as he helped her out of the boat. &quot;Are the
sahibs up above in the grove?&quot; he inquired of
the man.</p>

<p class="indent">The answer was given with drowsy indifference.
&quot;I know not. The order was given to wait for this
boat, and take it back with the other.&quot;<span class="pagenum"><a name="page157" id="page157"></a>[pg&nbsp;157]</span>
They stumbled on up the slope that was steep
and uneven, Trixie clinging to Guy, her breath
coming fast and audible. &quot;Do coo-ee,&quot; she urged
him, &quot;I feel I must know if they're there.&quot; He
obeyed her. His voice rang clear through the trees
and over the river, but echo was all the reply it
received.</p>

<p class="indent">In disconsolate silence they reached the flat
ground at the top of the cliff, and plunged into the
mysterious gloom of the grove. A weak little
breeze had arisen, wandering through the trees,
like a sighing soul that could not escape from the
burial place; here and there they could see the dim
outlines of tombs, dome-shaped, or flat-topped and
square, touched by the light of the moon that
filtered down through the foliage.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;They are not here. They have gone,&quot; said
Trixie hopelessly.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;They are outside, waiting on the road,&quot; said
Guy Greaves.</p>

<p class="indent">But they were not. When the pair emerged
from the grove they found the road empty and
silent, not a sign of a trap or anything living,
except a great owl that swooped over the road and
across the unfertile plain beyond with an unearthly
hoot, as though mocking their plight.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Come along,&quot; said Trixie firmly, &quot;we must
walk. If they do send the trap back to meet us
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page158" id="page158"></a>[pg&nbsp;158]</span>
so much the better, but we can't wait here on the
chance.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The road was unmetalled and the ruts were
deep. Without further parley they started, trudging
through the dust, engrossed in their own
emotions. The boy felt that by his lack of self-control
he had jeopardised all future friendship
with his idol, and his young heart was heavy
with distress, also with resentment; for it seemed
to him that Trixie thought he was to blame for
their predicament. Barring that asinine outburst
of his, which he deeply regretted, he did not see
why she should be so perturbed--not only perturbed,
but actually frightened. If anyone should
be spiteful enough to gossip, the whole thing
could be clearly explained in two minutes. Why,
in the old days Trixie would have been the first
to enjoy such a harmless adventure. A question
crept into his mind and filled him with angry
concern: Was she afraid of her husband? He
recalled certain tales of his colonel's first marriage,
chiefly the one that Coventry's jealous restrictions
had goaded his wife into bolting with some other
fellow. Aunt Marion Greaves had once hinted
as much in his hearing, and others had said
the same. He stepped along burning with rage
at the notion that Trixie was bullied, devising
impossible schemes to shield and defend
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page159" id="page159"></a>[pg&nbsp;159]</span>
her from trouble with Coventry over to-night's
escapade.</p>

<p class="indent">Trixie herself was practically oblivious of his
presence. She did not observe that he walked a
little ahead, his motive being to make sure that
she trod on nothing suggestive of reptiles; once he
did notice a thin black line that wriggled from the
dust in front and disappeared beneath a cactus
clump. Luckily she did not see it; she was
absorbed in her desire to find herself safe within
her home, torn as she was with repentance for her
backsliding, dreading as she did the confession
she would have to make to George. Guy startled
her presently by an abrupt question:</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Why are you in such a funk?&quot; he asked, as
though the words had been jerked from his lips
against his will.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What?&quot; said Trixie, with an effort. &quot;What
did you say?&quot; She only knew he had spoken,
without catching the words.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I only said, why are you so awfully worried
about--about all this? There can't be any scandal
when the whole thing was simply an accident.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It wasn't an accident my going out with all
you silly idiots in the middle of the night!&quot; said
Trixie crossly. &quot;And if people do talk and say
nasty things about our being left behind it will
be my own fault, and I shall deserve it. Anyhow,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page160" id="page160"></a>[pg&nbsp;160]</span>
it has taught me a lesson I shan't forget in a
hurry.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, rot! What can they say? And why
should you care. Look here, Trixie,&quot; he burst out
with imprudent impetuosity, &quot;is it that you're in a
funk of what <i>the colonel</i> will say or do? For God's
sake, tell me if he bullies you. We all know
what happened about his first wife.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">There was an ominous pause. His pulses beat
quickly, the noise of their footsteps crunching the
dust sounded loud in his ears. He wished he had
let the subject alone.</p>

<p class="indent">Then he heard Trixie say in a cold, contemptuous
voice: &quot;Perhaps you will tell me what you
all know?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">In nervous excitement he stammered his answer.
&quot;Why, that he drove her into--into leaving him.
Never gave her a chance, wouldn't listen.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">And in spite of the anger she felt towards Guy
for his outrageous presumption, Trixie's heart sank
lower than ever. She knew so little of the history
of George's first marriage--had refused to hear
when her mother and &quot;Gommie&quot; had wanted to
tell her. Never once had she questioned her husband
about the divorce, and naturally no one had
mentioned it to her in India, until now this blundering
boy had raked up the talk he had heard.
A horrible doubt assailed her. Could it be true
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page161" id="page161"></a>[pg&nbsp;161]</span>
that George had behaved without mercy, had not
been entirely blameless as she had always believed?
If so, what might she expect herself when he knew
she had not only flown in the face of his wishes,
but had been absent nearly all night with Guy
Greaves, the one individual, harmless youth though
he was, with whom he had begged her not to make
herself conspicuous during their separation--Guy,
over whom they had almost quarrelled! Hurt and
annoyed she was sure her husband would be, but
what if, as well, he &quot;would not listen, would not
give her a chance?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Her vexation of mind, her disturbance of conscience,
the annoying delay, the scene with Guy
on the river, had all combined to harass her nerves
and distort her perceptions; and now her companion's
perturbing suggestion filled her with
dread. Nevertheless her spirit rose up in defence
of her husband.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You know nothing about it,&quot; she told Guy
severely. &quot;How dare you quote gossip to me!
And as to your insinuation about George's behaviour
towards me, it only just proves how little
you know him.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;They why make such a fuss?&quot; he argued
morosely. He did not believe that Trixie was
telling the truth.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Look here, Guy!&quot; She stopped in the middle
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page162" id="page162"></a>[pg&nbsp;162]</span>
of the road, and compelled him to turn and face
her. &quot;If you weren't such an old friend, and if
I didn't know you were a good sort, I should
never speak to you again. As it is, you must know
we can't be on quite the same terms any more.
But I should like you to understand, once and for
all, that I love my husband, and because I love
him it makes me wretched to think that I should
have done anything to vex him. I have broken
a promise and behaved like a senseless fool. Of
course I shall tell him the whole thing, and I am
not in the least afraid that he won't forgive me.
But that doesn't make me feel any the less ashamed
of myself.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">All the same, despite her brave words, Trixie
was frightened as well as ashamed, and in her
heart she knew that Guy had not only divined her
fear, but that he shared it himself acutely.</p>

<p class="indent">It was a blessed relief to them both to catch
sight at this moment of a dark object moving
slowly towards them along the road--Guy
Greaves's trap, sent back by the rest of the party
to meet them. In silence they got into the trap
and jolted along the uneven road till they reached
the metalled highway; then they spun swiftly, unhindered,
towards the station.</p>

<p class="h2a">THE JUNGLE</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> sun beat fiercely down on the bed of the river,
now dry save for streamlets meandering among
the boulders, and encircling patches of sand that
were dotted with birds of the long-shanked, long-billed
brotherhood. It seemed hard to believe that
a few weeks hence this arid, stone-strewn area
would be swept by a mighty, tempestuous flood,
rushing down from the hills in a volume so vast
that nothing could stem its advance. Now the
boulders shone round and smooth, and blinding
white in the midday heat. They might have been
cannon balls hurled by some Titan race in the ages
past from the amphitheatre of hills at some foe in
the valley beneath. The islets of sand sparkled
like gold; indeed, gold dust was known to be
mixed with their grains, though as yet whence it
came was a secret no man had discovered; at least,
if he had, the secret was kept by enchantment.
There were stories of venturesome pilgrims, returning
from far-away shrines in the mountains, found
dead by the road that led back to the world, with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page164" id="page164"></a>[pg&nbsp;164]</span>
nuggets of gold on their persons; no one had lived
to return to the spot where he found them.</p>

<p class="indent">The straggling line of elephants, lurching in
leisurely progress across the bed of the river,
showed like black blots among the boulders. The
animals felt their footing with careful precision,
splashing through narrow streams, avoiding the
stretches of sand that might prove to be death-traps
for ponderous beasts, tearing up wisps of
scrub with their trunks and beating them free of
dust before putting them into their mouths, or
flinging them far in disdain.</p>

<p class="indent">Captain Coventry's elephant brought up the
rear of the little procession. He sat idly back in
his howdah, his guns and his rifles stacked before
him. His thoughts had wandered from river-beds,
elephants, &quot;kills,&quot; and tigers; for the tents of the
camp, gleaming white in a grove of trees on the
opposite bank, had attracted his eye, and he was
hoping to find a letter from Trixie awaiting him
there. His face was burnt by the sun to the hue
of a brick, he looked lean and hard and in fine
condition. The fortnight in camp had been all
to his taste--congenial companions, capital sport,
the arrangements as perfect as only a hunter such
as his host could have made them.</p>

<p class="indent">This morning the camp had moved, therefore
sport on the march had been varied. Two pad
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page165" id="page165"></a>[pg&nbsp;165]</span>
elephants carried the game--spotted deer, jungle
fowl, partridge, a wild boar with tushes like
ivory sickles, and, chief of all, a magnificent
panther, shot by Coventry as it lay stretched
along the branch of a tree, watching with
wicked green eyes the party of sportsmen filing
beneath.</p>

<p class="indent">Coventry's leave was nearing its close. In a
couple of days he was due to return to the station,
and he sometimes surprised himself counting the
hours. But he did not intend to desert &quot;the shoot&quot;
before the appointed time, especially since the
object in moving the camp to-day was to get within
reach of a man-eating tiger whose terrible doings
had scared all the people for miles around. The
inhabitants of the little jungle villages were almost
paralysed with fear, their crops were neglected,
they dared not take out their cattle to graze; the
brute was as active by day as by night, and had
even been known to come into a hut and drag
out his victim. From all accounts he was not of
the usual mangy type that, enfeebled by age, finds
man a much easier prey than the deer or the
buffalo; he was described by the people as a
creature of monstrous proportions, in the prime
of life, and possessed with a spirit that was without
doubt of the devil, since he slew beasts for caprice
or amusement, and human beings for food. Many
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page166" id="page166"></a>[pg&nbsp;166]</span>
were &quot;the sahibs&quot; who had sought to destroy him,
on foot, from howdahs, from seats in the trees; in
vain had bullocks and goats and buffalo calves
been tied up as bait; even the ghastly remains
of his meals had been watched. Yet still he went
free, the &quot;slayer,&quot; the &quot;striped one,&quot; the &quot;lord
of the jungle.&quot; (No villager mentions the tiger by
name, for fear of ill-luck.)</p>

<p class="indent">As the sportsmen arrived in their camp they
were met by a terrified group, a deputation of
wretched, half-naked people who had come from
a hamlet near by to report yet another disaster.
They waited while the sahibs got down from the
elephants and stretched their cramped limbs, and
then they approached with humble yet eager
appeal.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Highness, protector of the poor, father and
mother, we are humble folk,&quot; wailed the spokesman,
prostrating himself at their feet, a mummified
object with rags round his head and his loins.
&quot;Thy slaves do entreat thee to slay the 'shaitan'
that stalketh by day and by night. No one is
safe. Only last night did the evil one fall on
the wife of my nephew as she went forth to draw
water from the well. In front of our eyes did he
spring out and seize her and carry her off in his
jaws; and when her husband ran in pursuit, like
a fool, with curses and cries, did the evil one pause
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page167" id="page167"></a>[pg&nbsp;167]</span>
and look back. And he threw down the woman
and smote the man also, then bore the woman
away to the jungle. If it should be the sahibs'
pleasure to know that this dust speaks but truth,
will we guide the huzoors to the spot where my
nephew lies hurt unto death in the village. Maybe
he is dead by now.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Again the deputation salaamed, as one man,
to the ground, then stood gazing at the sahibs in
hopeful anticipation.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;We'd better go and see if there's anything
to be done for the wretched beggar,&quot; suggested
Markham; &quot;and if the tiger should be about and
come for us, so much the better; we'll polish
him off.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">All four &quot;sahibs&quot; were hot and hungry and
thirsty. Coventry was hungry for his letters, as
well as for his breakfast. But without further
delay they followed the squalid, excited little band
in single file along a jungle track, their rifles under
their arms. They passed through a sea of feathery
grass that grew high above their heads, and on
among dense bamboo thickets and tangled scrub.
They were close to the edge of the forest, and
the rustle of the tree-tops in the fierce west
wind was unceasing. Their boots sank deep
into hot, dry dust; sometimes startled animals
darted across the track almost between their
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page168" id="page168"></a>[pg&nbsp;168]</span>
feet--little hog deer, squirrels, hares, jackals
that slunk noiselessly into the grass. The harsh
calling of pea-fowl, the chatter of monkeys, the
screams of green parrots resounded above them.
The heat was like that of a furnace; it was a
blessed relief to emerge from the close-bound path
on to a clearing in front of the village. It was
a pathetic little patch of habitation, the people
members of a jungle tribe not far removed from
aborigines; just a cluster of mud-built dwellings
thatched with grass, a shallow tank covered with
green slime, in which pigs and buffaloes wallowed;
refuse was scattered about, and on a rudely constructed
platform under the usual peepal tree a
few aged human beings, wasted with fever and
poverty, sat huddled together; naked children with
swollen stomachs played at their feet, and mangy
pariah dogs met the arrivals with furious barking.
It was just such a place as a man-eating tiger
could persecute at his pleasure.</p>

<p class="indent">Coventry never forgot the sickening scene that
followed. He and his friends were conducted with
noisy ceremony into a hut that already seemed
crowded with people; women were wailing, the
smell and the heat and the dimness of the interior
were stifling in their effect, and on a low string
bedstead lay a twisted form partially covered with
rags.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page169" id="page169"></a>[pg&nbsp;169]</span>
The patriarch who had led the deputation to the
camp stepped forward full of importance.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Behold, sahibs, this is the doing of the
destroyer!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">To the horror of the Englishmen, before they
could check him, he lifted the mask of the unfortunate
victim by the nose, and held it poised in the
air for a moment before he replaced it. Mercifully
the man was dead, only just dead, however; he
had lived through the night and into the day with
the whole of his face, from the scalp to the chin,
torn away by the tiger.</p>

<hr />

<p class="indent">&quot;What extraordinary beggars these jungle
people seem to be! I believe that old brute this
morning would have lifted off that poor devil's
face just the same if we'd got there while he was
alive; in fact, I don't think he knew he was dead.&quot;
The speaker, one of the shooting party, was a
young man fresh to India, and this his first experience
of the jungle had been full, for him, of excitement
and wonder.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Probably not,&quot; said Markham; &quot;the callousness
of the Oriental does strike one as pretty
brutal sometimes, but it's just an acceptance of
misfortune ingrained in them by their religion.
In their own way they are charitable and kind-hearted,
and they are often brave to rashness.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page170" id="page170"></a>[pg&nbsp;170]</span>
When you come to think what that village has
endured, you'd imagine there'd be hardly a sane
inhabitant left.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The murmur of voices reached Coventry's brain
as from a distance, though the two who were talking
were only a few paces from him. He lay half
asleep on a long camp chair in the shade, Trixie's
letters clasped in his hand--a three days' budget
brought out by runners from the nearest point of
postal communication. Trixie was well, she had
written, but she missed him, the time had seemed
long, she was glad it was nearly over. Holding
her letters he dreamed, as he dozed, of their meeting,
while the murmur of voices went on....
Then as he stirred he caught snatches of talk
through his dreams, now distinct, now connected,
as drowsiness lifted.</p>

<p class="indent">The boy was saying: &quot;You must have seen
some curious things in your time, I suppose, sir?&quot;
He spoke with the awe and respect of youth for
age and experience, as though Markham might be
a hundred years old at the least.</p>

<p class="indent">Coventry listened, amused, and kept his eyes
closed. He knew that if Markham chose, he
could tell some odd stories. He lay quiet and
listened.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well, yes, I suppose I have,&quot; Markham said
musingly; and Coventry heard him knocking his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page171" id="page171"></a>[pg&nbsp;171]</span>
pipe on his chair before he refilled it. The words
and the sound were hopeful. Coventry lay quiet
and listened.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Is there any truth in the tales about children
being carried away, and brought up by wolves in
the jungle?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Undoubtedly. I once saw one myself;
in fact, I'm sorry to say I shot the poor
creature.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The boy gasped. Markham went on:</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;We were out at the foot of the hills after
bear, and coming back to camp one evening something
jumped out of the long grass and I fired.
You see, I don't often miss, and the thing was
dead when we picked it up. It wasn't a monkey,
as we thought at first; it was a wild man, covered
with hair, and evidently it had always gone on
its hands and knees.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;And what did you do?&quot; came the breathless
question.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Buried it,&quot; said Markham briefly, &quot;and said
nothing about it.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, do go on!&quot; urged the boy, enthralled.</p>

<p class="indent">Markham laughed. &quot;Let me think,&quot; he said
indulgently. &quot;Well, last year I went up towards
the head of the Ganges to shoot crocodile with a
fellow who thought he was going to make money
over the skins--selling them for bags and cases,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page172" id="page172"></a>[pg&nbsp;172]</span>
and so on--and one morning a villager came to
the camp and asked us to shoot the 'mugger'
that had swallowed his wife the day before. He
was a washerman, and he said he and the woman
had just taken the clothes down to the edge of
the river, and had begun to wash them, when a
crocodile the size of a boat, as he described it,
suddenly rose from the water and dragged his
wife under. He declared the beast swallowed her
whole then and there, and he seemed awfully put
out because she was wearing the whole of her
jewellery into which they had put all their savings--as
the peasant people are in the habit of
doing out here. He added that we should know
her by that, and by her long hair. She had the
longest hair, he informed us with pride, of any
woman in the village. He didn't seem to understand
that we might shoot dozens of crocodiles
and never come across the one that had swallowed
his wife; he kept saying we couldn't mistake it
because it was the biggest crocodile that had ever
been seen or heard of, and he went away perfectly
confident that he would get the jewellery back.
Oddly enough next day we did see a monster, and
managed to bag him, and when we cut him open
there was the wretched woman in his inside--jewellery,
and long hair, and all! The whole
village turned out and salaamed to us as if we had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page173" id="page173"></a>[pg&nbsp;173]</span>
been gods, and they became such a nuisance we
had to move on.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Hullo, Markham! Yarning?&quot; Another
member of the shoot came out of his tent fresh
from a snooze, and flung himself into an empty
chair. &quot;What is it? Ghosts, or tigers, or murders,
or witchcraft?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It's your turn now,&quot; said Markham good-temperedly;
&quot;tell him the most hair-raising tale
you can think of, and give me a rest. As a policeman
you ought to know plenty.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Plenty,&quot; replied the policeman, and yawned.
&quot;But I can't remember any just now. It's too hot,
and I'm too sleepy.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But you must come across such <i>interesting</i>
things in the bazaars!&quot; said the boy, in a pleading
voice. His ambition had been to write, to
become an author, to follow in the footsteps of
Stevenson, Kipling, and other great masters of
romance; but his people, being practical, had
scolded and pushed him into the Indian Public
Works, and he had no time to use his pen for
anything but estimates, reports, and office work,
which bored his imaginative soul.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I did come across an odd little echo of the
past only the other day,&quot; the policeman admitted
with an effort. &quot;I had breakfast one morning with
some missionaries in an out-of-the-way corner of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page174" id="page174"></a>[pg&nbsp;174]</span>
my district, and I noticed an old Englishwoman
wandering about the compound with an ayah in
attendance. She was dressed in grey, with a poke
bonnet and full skirts, like the pictures in old
<i>Punches</i>. They told me she had been found at the
time of the Mutiny as a young girl of about fifteen
hiding in the jungle wearing native clothes. Nobody
knew who she was, and the poor thing
couldn't tell them because she was out of her mind,
and she had never recovered her reason. She had
been handed on to these people by the missionaries
they succeeded, and by others before them--and
there she had been living for over fifty years, perfectly
harmless, costing very little, and only insisting
on being dressed in grey and in the fashion
of the Mutiny time. If they tried to put her into
anything else she only cried and protested pitifully,
so they just went on copying the garments,
and called her 'Miss Grey.' They can
only suppose that her people were killed in the
outbreak, and that some faithful servant disguised
her and hid her in the jungle, and that
then she got lost and went out of her mind with
terror.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;And no one will ever know who she was, or
what really happened,&quot; said the boy, drawing a
long breath. &quot;Unless, perhaps, when she is
dying it may all come back to her?&quot;<span class="pagenum"><a name="page175" id="page175"></a>[pg&nbsp;175]</span>
&quot;It's to be hoped it won't,&quot; said the policeman,
who was not a romanticist.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It was lucky for 'Miss Grey' that she was
found by friends,&quot; put in Markham. &quot;By the
way, do you remember that case a few years
ago----&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Somnolence stole over Coventry's brain once
more; the voices droned on and grew fainter, floating
away into space; his head drooped again, and
he found himself back in the station, not at all
disconcerted because, with the curious inconsequence
of dreams, his bungalow and the racquet
court had in some marvellous manner been merged
into one. He was playing an excellent game,
though the furniture got in the way and Trixie
kept trying to stop him. She was saying:
&quot;George, do come away--think of the woman in
the bazaar&quot;; and a crowd of men standing by
shouted in chorus: &quot;Yes, remember, old chap, the
woman in the bazaar.&quot; Then he fell over a chair
in the act of making a wonderful stroke, and as,
with a jerk, he awoke, he heard Markham repeating--&quot;woman
in the bazaar.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What on earth are you gassing about?&quot; he
said crossly. His head ached, and he felt hot and
sticky, in spite of his recent tub.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;The case of that woman whose husband did
something he shouldn't connected with money, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page176" id="page176"></a>[pg&nbsp;176]</span>
got put into prison, and she drifted into one of
the big bazaars----&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What, an Englishwoman?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes, worse luck. It was some years ago--while
you were at home, I suppose; but there
was a tremendous fuss made about it at the
time, and I believe the Government tried to
interfere and to pay her way home, but didn't
succeed----&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;That sort of thing isn't so uncommon as
you'd think,&quot; observed the policeman significantly.
&quot;Our service comes up against queer things in
that direction.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, do for Heaven's sake shut up!&quot; exclaimed
Coventry, with the captiousness of the
newly awakened. &quot;We've had quite enough
horrors to last us for one day, at least, what with
that business in the village this morning, and now
all your infernal reminiscences.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The cause of his dream became clear to him
now. While he dozed the conversation around him
had recalled to his subconscious mind the unsavoury
rumour he had heard in the racquet court
one evening--the evening on which, subsequently,
he had felt so annoyed with his wife and with
young Greaves for staying out late.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;We thought you were asleep,&quot; said Markham
in a tone of provoking apology.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page177" id="page177"></a>[pg&nbsp;177]</span>
&quot;So I was, and you woke me up with your
jabber.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It's time you were awake,&quot; Markham said,
rising. &quot;We ought to be off pretty soon to the
machans.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">With the courage and skill of his tribe, the
shikari had tracked the tiger, and discovered the
spot where the mangled remains of the woman lay
hidden beneath the bush. This was not far from
the village, and during the day the tracker had
fashioned <i>machans</i>, or rough seats, in the trees for
the sahibs, and had tied up a buffalo calf near by
as additional bait. In an hour or two the tiger
might be on the prowl and return to his hideous
meal, though a man-eater's movements are always
uncertain--one day, or one night, he may pounce
on his prey, and be heard of again next morning
five or six miles away; unlike his kindred of more
conventional habits, who will kill about every three
days, and return as a rule to the carcase two or
three times.</p>

<p class="indent">It was a long and wearisome wait, sitting
cramped and motionless in the trees. Tigers will
seldom look up, but the very least noise--a
whisper, a movement, a creak of a seat, or the
crack of a twig--is sufficient to warn them, and,
once suspicious, nothing will tempt them to come
within range; they will slink off in silence and slay
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page178" id="page178"></a>[pg&nbsp;178]</span>
elsewhere. Coventry and the boy were perched on
one platform, their backs against the trunk; lots
had been drawn for the seats, and they had been
lucky. Their place was just over the bait that was
living, and they could see a twisted brown object
protruding from under the bush where the tiger
had hidden his victim--an arm of the corpse, as
the blue glass bangles that still encircled the poor
little wrist betokened.</p>

<p class="indent">The sun began to go down, flooding the scene
with a rose-coloured radiance, and the moon was
not due to rise until late. The air was close and
the jungle intensely still, save for the humming of
countless insects, and sometimes the cry of a peacock,
piercing and harsh, in the distance. As the
light softened and faded a rustling in the grass
told of porcupines that had come out to feed; they
seemed, as the boy said afterwards, to be running
about like rabbits. Suddenly a shabby little jackal
emerged from the undergrowth, noiselessly, with
caution; for a moment he stood still and snuffed
the air, then he whisked his brush and gave a wild,
unearthly yell, repeating it at intervals, and danced
and capered in such fantastic fashion that the boy
shook with suppressed amusement.</p>

<p class="indent">But Coventry stiffened his muscles. He remembered
the native belief that some jackals are
&quot;pheaows,&quot; or providers, by trade, and are supposed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page179" id="page179"></a>[pg&nbsp;179]</span>
to precede the tiger and utter weird cries
either to warn him of danger or to announce some
find of food. Whether such a belief was based
on truth, or whether such conduct was merely the
outcome of fear, he knew that the &quot;pheaow's&quot;
arrival, with yells and with antics, usually proclaimed
the approach of a tiger, and that in all
probability it did so now. With a final contortion
and a last demoniacal cry the creature fled into
covert, and silence again descended, broken only
by queer little scuffling noises below and the twittering
of owls in the trees. Then a troop of brown
monkeys came crashing and chattering through
the trees, throwing themselves from branch to
branch in a state of the wildest excitement; and the
buffalo calf, that had so far lain content on the
ground, got up and showed symptoms of fear.</p>

<p class="indent">Coventry felt certain that the tiger was about,
but except for the angry scoldings of the monkeys,
and the nervous lowing of the calf, there was
nothing to denote the close vicinity of any beast of
prey. Time stole on and darkness fell. If the
tiger chose to come between the setting of the sun
and the rising of the moon there would be little
hope of bagging him. The sportsmen had agreed
that if he should delay they would wait until the
moonlight gave a better chance, or even till the
dawn.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page180" id="page180"></a>[pg&nbsp;180]</span>
Nothing happened, though an intangible vibration
in the air kept the human senses tightly strung
through the interval of darkness that ensued. Now
and then points of light moved over the ground
like glow-worms--the eyes of small animals seeking
their food.</p>

<p class="indent">Then the moon came up, full and serene, the
colour of a ripe blood-orange, and threw her molten
light upon the scene, till every blade and stick and
leaf stood out, sharp and clear, against their own
black shadows. The moments seemed interminable,
every sound was magnified a hundredfold
by the mysterious quiet--the soft fluttering of bats,
the breathing of the buffalo calf, the furtive rustles
in the grass. Coventry was stiff and tired, he felt
half hypnotised; the light was so unnatural, a sort
of weird enchantment held the jungle; if a band
of sprites and goblins had appeared and danced
wildly in a circle he would not have been surprised.
He was near the borderland of dreams,
and he tried to keep himself awake by thinking of
the tiger, of Trixie, of his journey back to the
station; but to his annoyance one sentence swung
backwards and forwards, like a pendulum, through
his brain to the exclusion of everything else: &quot;The
woman in the bazaar. The woman in the bazaar.&quot;
He longed at last to cry it aloud, that he might
free his mind from its spell. Why should these
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page181" id="page181"></a>[pg&nbsp;181]</span>
words have laid hold of his mind with such provoking
persistence? He began to wonder if he
had fever, if he had been &quot;touched up&quot; by the
sun this morning; certainly his bones were aching
and his head felt queer, but that might be due to
the wearisome wait and the cramped position. He
attempted to find his pulse, but he could not determine
whether the beats were too fast, or too slow,
or only just normal; and still the sentence clanged
to and fro in his brain, &quot;The woman in the bazaar.
The woman in the bazaar.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Then above it his ears caught a tangible sound,
though at first so stealthy, so faint, as to be almost
inaudible. Again it came, this time a little more
certain, a careful stir in the grass, a movement so
soft and so wary, so light, that it might have been
made by a snake. Afterwards silence, a silence
charged with supreme suspense and excitement for
the watchers alert in the trees; they hardly dared
breathe. The buffalo calf strained at its tether, but
uttered no sound, the poor little creature was dumb
with fear.</p>

<p class="indent">Five minutes later something came out of the
grass--a long, lithe form that looked grey in the
moonlight, that wriggled along the ground with
head held low and shoulders humped high; truly
a very big tiger, though doubtless the rays of the
moon enlarged its appearance unduly. Coventry
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page182" id="page182"></a>[pg&nbsp;182]</span>
was reminded of a cat stalking a bird as the beast
made a noiseless run towards the buffalo calf and
then paused, the muscles rippling under the skin
from the large flat head, with ears laid back, to
the tip of the tail, that quivered and jerked.</p>

<p class="indent">By the laws of sport it was Coventry's shot,
for the tiger was nearest to his machan. He caught
an agonised whisper of &quot;Shoot, for God's sake!&quot;
from the boy, and he raised his rifle.</p>

<p class="indent">The weapon felt strangely top-heavy, it swayed
in his hands, a mist seemed to rise between him
and the sight, and as the report rang out he knew
he had missed--missed badly. Almost at once
there came other reports from the trees in sharp
succession, and a roar of such fury and pain as
shook the air, echoing far and near through the
forest.</p>

<p class="indent">The man-eater's death was terrific. Over and
over he rolled, gasping, roaring, biting the earth
in his struggles, till with a hoarse, gurgling sigh
he lay still, and his crimes were ended.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XII" id="CHAPTER_XII"></a>CHAPTER XII</h2>

<p class="h2a">IN THE BAZAAR</p>

<p><span class="smcap">As</span> was to be expected the camp took a rest next
morning. When Coventry left his tent the hot
wind had lulled, and the shadows of the trees had
stretched half-way across the tract of bare ground
that led to the edge of the jungle. He looked a
wreck, for the touch of malaria that had ruffled
his temper the previous evening, and ruined his
chance of killing the tiger, had since developed
into a sharp though short attack with the usual
ague, and a temperature that would terrify those
unacquainted with the common complaint of the
country. It is surprising how quickly malarial
fever in India can lay a man low, and yet leave
him strength sufficient to rise, once it is over, and
pursue his general doings as though nothing unusual
had happened. Many even continue to work
with fever actually on them.

All the way home from the forest Coventry had
shivered and grumbled and scolded the rest of the
party because he had missed the tiger, and now,
though the fever had left him, he felt languid and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page184" id="page184"></a>[pg&nbsp;184]</span>
limp, and peevish, and was hardly the best of companions.
On the outskirts of the camp the man-eater's
skin was being pegged out to dry surrounded
by a chattering concourse. Half the
village had been in the camp since daybreak,
squatting around the carcase, helping to rub the
raw skin with ashes, lauding the sahibs who had
slain the destroyer, rejoicing over the death of the
enemy. Now they could travel in safety, at least
for the present, could tend their crops, and take
out their cattle to graze. Their gratitude did not
deter them, however, from furtive attempts to annex
the whiskers and claws, and lumps of the fat said
to be a miraculous cure for rheumatism. There
was to be a &quot;tomasha&quot; to-night in the village to
celebrate the event, with music and feasting and
fireworks, for which, with the usual fate of the
benefactor, the sahibs were expected to pay.</p>

<p class="indent">Coventry sat dreamily watching the group.
The shikari was directing his assistants, abusing
them in the loud arbitrary voice that the native
so often assumes towards those whom he considers
to be his inferiors, holding forth at the same
time on the subject of tigers in general. Most of
the servants were idling round, joining in the
jokes and altercations; and big, blue-black crows
skipped boldly into the midst of the gathering,
snatching at morsels of flesh and cawing in hoarse
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page185" id="page185"></a>[pg&nbsp;185]</span>
excitement. Near at hand some vultures, bald and
repulsive, had collected, gloating in expectation of
a feast; overhead, in the hard blue sky, kites were
soaring, and diving and screaming. In the background
the elephants, chained to their posts,
showed massive and dark, swinging their heads,
beating off the flies with branches of trees or wisps
of their fodder held in their trunks.</p>

<p class="indent">It was a picturesque scene alluring to a sportsman,
yet Coventry was conscious of a sudden
satiety of sport and all its appurtenances. He had
enjoyed the shoot, had been thoroughly keen
throughout, but whether the fever was to blame, or
his annoyance at missing the tiger, or the nostalgia
for wife and home that had been on the increase
the last few days, he now felt he wished never to
hear of a tiger or find himself in a machan or a
howdah again. He looked at his watch--it had
struck him that if he could start to-night he might
catch the mail train before the one by which he
had meant to travel. Trixie would be so surprised
and delighted to see him arrive before he was due;
she must have had a dull, empty time, poor child,
during his absence. He inferred as much from
her letters, though she never complained; Trixie
was not one to grumble or whine. He reproached
himself for having left her alone, and determined
to try and make up to her for his selfishness;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page186" id="page186"></a>[pg&nbsp;186]</span>
should he buy her some nice piece of jewellery
when he got back? A new ring. Trixie liked
rings, and they looked so well on her pretty pink
fingers. Later on he would take her away to the
hills and let her enjoy herself just as she liked.
Then jealousy stirred in his heart, and whispered:
&quot;Of course, within reason.&quot; He tried to stifle the
whisper, but could not succeed; after all, if Trixie
kept well she ought to be happy enough in the
plains with him, and her pets, and the riding and
tennis.</p>

<p class="indent">Markham came out of his tent. &quot;Better, old
chap?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes, better, fairly all right again, thanks. I
think I'll go off, though, to-night, all the same. I
don't feel quite up to another day's beat with a
journey to follow. If I hurry a bit I could catch
the mail in the morning.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You might, but it'll be rather a rush, and
you'll get no sleep.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I can sleep in the train to-morrow.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The desire to start had now become almost an
obsession, and he held out obstinately against
Markham's well-meant persuasions that he should
wait, as previously planned, to benefit by the
arrangements already concluded for the convenient
return of the party to the nearest junction on the
railway. Finally it was settled that he should
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page187" id="page187"></a>[pg&nbsp;187]</span>
journey on one of the elephants to a point of habitation
where some sort of vehicle could be procured
to take him to meet the earlier mail.</p>

<p class="indent">Therefore it came about that George Coventry,
with his bearer and his baggage, rattled up to his
bungalow in a dilapidated &quot;ticca-gharry,&quot; hired at
the railway station, twelve hours sooner than he
was expected. From the moment of his catching,
as by a miracle, the earlier mail train, he had been
thrilled with sweet impatience, anticipating Trixie's
welcome, all her glad surprise, their interchange
of little news, the pleasant disturbance of his premature
home-coming. Her last letter, which was
safe in his breast pocket, together with all the
others she had written to him during his absence,
had told him how she longed for his return, had
declared that the final twenty-four hours would
seem longer, more tedious than all the rest. To
shorten the time of separation he had jolted and
bumped over miles of rough country, enduring
horrible discomfort, that he might arrive to-night
instead of to-morrow, even if he roused her and
the establishment at an inconvenient hour.</p>

<p class="indent">Needless to say, his much-needed sleep in the
train had been broken and restless. Fever still
lurked in his system, and whenever he dozed the
beat of the wheels had formed itself into a clockwork
song with relentless persistence: &quot;The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page188" id="page188"></a>[pg&nbsp;188]</span>
woman in the bazaar. The woman in the bazaar.&quot;
He could not get rid of it, could not divert its
maddening rhythm. Even now as he got out of
the gharry it followed him up the steps and
clamoured inside his brain.</p>

<p class="indent">The bungalow was silent, dimly lit. A servant
lay rolled up in a cotton sheet, like a corpse, across
the threshold of the drawing-room door, which was
open. Why was the door open? Why were the
venetian outer doors not closed and bolted?</p>

<p class="indent">The gharry, with his baggage on the roof, the
sleepy driver and the miserable ponies, waited at
the foot of the veranda steps while the sahib awoke
the slumbering servant both with voice and foot.</p>

<p class="indent">The man sprang up with the terrified bewilderment
of the suddenly awakened native. &quot;Thieves!
Murder! Thieves!&quot; he yelled, until he recognised
his master, when he bound his turban hastily
about his dishevelled head and salaamed in respectful
apology. The gharry man was paid, the luggage
was deposited in the veranda, and the ramshackle
conveyance rattled out of the compound.
It all caused a noisy disturbance, and yet Trixie
had not been aroused. No questioning call came
from her bedroom to know what it all meant. In
puzzled apprehension Coventry passed through the
drawing-room, where a couple of wall lamps still
burned low. Also the light in her bedroom had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page189" id="page189"></a>[pg&nbsp;189]</span>
not been put out. He pushed aside the short curtain
and looked into the room. She was not there.
The bed was empty, undisturbed.</p>

<p class="indent">He returned to the drawing-room and called the
bearer. &quot;Where has the memsahib gone to dine?&quot;
he asked, realising at the same moment that it was
long past the hour for dinner parties to break up.</p>

<p class="indent">The man told him blandly that he &quot;believed the
memsahib had gone to dine with Captain Roy-memsahib,&quot;
then added, standing on one foot and
rubbing a great toe against the other ankle, that
he thought the syce had brought the &quot;tum-tum&quot;
back some time ago.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Call the syce!&quot; said Coventry shortly; and
the bearer obeyed, obviously relieved that he was
to be questioned no further, since the sahib seemed
annoyed.</p>

<p class="indent">The syce, a dull but well-intentioned person,
could only say that the memsahib had told him to
take the cart and the pony home from Roy-mem's
bungalow. He did not know why. He also stood
on one foot, vaguely apprehensive of the Colonel-sahib's
displeasure.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It was the memsahib's order,&quot; he added in
hopeful self-exoneration.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Very well,&quot; said Coventry; &quot;go and get the
tum-tum ready.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">He stood and smoked in the veranda until the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page190" id="page190"></a>[pg&nbsp;190]</span>
trap came round. His mind was in chaos; he
could not think connectedly. What was Trixie
doing? Had she been taken ill at Mrs. Roy's
bungalow? Or had Mrs. Roy been taken ill, and
was Trixie staying with her for the night? Either
reason, lots of reasons, would explain her absence.
Yet beneath the plausible explaining there lurked
a dreadful doubt that clutched malevolently at his
heart.</p>

<p class="indent">He got into his trap and swung rapidly out of
the compound. In the light of the moon the dust-white
road had a luminous appearance. Coventry
remembered that the shortest route to the Roys'
bungalow was by the bazaar; he judged that at
this time of the night the streets would be clear.
He would save a mile at least if he drove through
the city.</p>

<p class="indent">He came to the outskirts of the great northern
native town, a huddle of thatched huts, their thresholds
blocked with sleeping forms. Pariah dogs
fought and foraged among the rubbish festering in
the gutters; their snarls mingled with raucous
native coughing, the wail of fretful infants, long
echoing yawns.</p>

<p class="indent">Then brick walls rose up, dark and irregular,
topped with flat roofs, whence rose faint sounds
of music and the murmur of voices. Now he
had entered one of the main streets of the city
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page191" id="page191"></a>[pg&nbsp;191]</span>
that yet was hardly wider than a lane; here and
there the road space was rendered still narrower by
rough string bedsteads set outside the shops and
dwellings, figures, scantily clothed, sprawling
upon them. Bats flickered from the roofs across
the strip of moonlit sky that was like a lid to the
street. The air was stifling; indescribable exhalations,
odours of kerosene oil, rancid butter, garlic,
sandal-wood, spices, sweating Eastern humanity,
thickened and soured the atmosphere, nauseating
the white man who drove steadily on through the
densely packed clusters of buildings. His head
ached, his veins felt as though they must burst in
his temples; it seemed to him that he had been
driving for hours through this fetid wilderness of
bricks, as if he should never emerge into air that
was pure and untainted.</p>

<p class="indent">The beat of his pony's hoofs echoed loud and
regular from wall to wall; otherwise there was a
heavy silence as he drove through the silversmiths'
quarter, and went past the side street where shoes
and sandals were made and sold, a fact proclaimed
by a horrible stench of badly cured hide. Suddenly
he came upon a patch of light and noise.
Some important domestic event was in course of
celebration, perhaps a wedding, or the birth of a
much-desired son. Rows of little lamps illumined
one of the houses, just wicks alight floating in pans
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page192" id="page192"></a>[pg&nbsp;192]</span>
of coco-nut oil, diffusing smoke and smell; a gaudy
group of nautch girls singing, twirling, blocked
the doorway, and a crowd of musicians and guests
and sightseers pushed and jostled each other for
some distance down the street. Somehow he got
through the flare, and confusion, and clamour, into
the dimness beyond, only to find his way barred
by a procession of camels padding towards him
in shadowy, leisurely progress, groaning and
grumbling, escorted by tall men clad in flowing
garments and loose turbans, men with snaky black
locks, hooked noses and fierce eyes; a camel
caravan arriving from the north, laden with merchandise,
weary and dusty with arduous travel.</p>

<p class="indent">Coventry was forced to halt. It would be impossible
in this narrow thoroughfare to get past
the long line of beasts burdened with huge bales
that swung broadside from their backs. The syce
stood up behind him to proffer advice.</p>

<p class="indent">That street, he said--the one to the left--would
take them into another main road and thence out
of the city just as quickly as if they waited for the
camel folk to pass.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It is the street,&quot; added the syce casually, &quot;of
the dancing women and such-like.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The leading camel, a towering, loose-lipped
shape, lurched and lumbered almost on to the trap.
Coventry, to avoid the bubbling beast, turned his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page193" id="page193"></a>[pg&nbsp;193]</span>
pony's head, and next moment he was driving
down the side street, down &quot;the street of the
dancing women and such-like.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Some of the balconies were silent and deserted,
others held shadowy shapes; one or two interiors
were ablaze with light, and the sound of tinkling
music floated from them. There came to his mind
the recollection of the hideous story he had heard
on the racquet court, now some weeks ago, and
he glanced about him with aversion.</p>

<p class="indent">The road was rough, scored with ruts and little
hollows. Presently the pony stumbled badly,
made a desperate struggle to regain his balance,
and came down. By an acrobatic leap Coventry
avoided being pitched into the road, the syce was
shot beneath the seat of the trap, and the pony lay
motionless, inert, in helpless submission to fate.</p>

<p class="indent">Coventry stood for a moment to steady his
senses. The syce crawled from the trap, rubbing
his leg, calling encouragement to the prostrate
pony, blaming some omen of evil he had observed
in the stables only that morning. It was evident,
even in the uncertain light, that the trap was badly
damaged; both shafts were broken, and Coventry
realised that he would drive no farther that night.</p>

<p class="indent">By now a small crowd had collected, men and
youths chiefly of the Babu persuasion, wearing
muslin shawls and embroidered pork-pie caps.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page194" id="page194"></a>[pg&nbsp;194]</span>
They gazed with relish at the spectacle of a white
man in a rather undignified quandary, and none
of them offered to help while sahib and syce busied
themselves with the pony.</p>

<p class="indent">Attracted by the little commotion, a woman
emerged on to a balcony above, and stood looking
down on the group. From the room behind her
someone brought out a lamp and held it aloft,
so that the woman's face became suddenly visible
to those in the street below.</p>

<p class="indent">Coventry looked up involuntarily, and his attention
was held, riveted, for, though not young,
the woman was fair, most strangely fair, in her
native dress and tinselled veil; and even the paint
that was thick on her eyes and cheeks could not
conceal her unusual beauty. Coventry guessed,
with a sick conviction, that this was &quot;the woman
in the bazaar,&quot; the woman of whom he had heard.</p>

<p class="indent">Appalled by the certainty, he still peered upward,
fascinated yet repelled; and softly the woman
laughed--not only laughed, but threw something
down that landed, lightly, at his feet. A hoarse
murmur of comment went up from the onlookers;
one of them, a weedy youth, picked the object up
and tendered it to the sahib, exclaiming with insolent
politeness: &quot;Thou art favoured, heaven-born.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">It was a bunch of crudely artificial violets,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page195" id="page195"></a>[pg&nbsp;195]</span>
drenched with heavy scent that mingled with other
odours of the suffocating night. Coventry recoiled
as though the sham flowers, with their sickly perfume,
had been a deadly reptile. Then he stepped
forward, menace in his bearing, and the officious
youth, with his companions, shrank, close-packed,
from the wrath of the Englishman; only to be
scattered by the noisy progress down the narrow
street of a clumsy, scarlet-hooded vehicle on four
wheels, drawn by a pair of powerful white bullocks.
It was a wonderful conveyance, gold-braided,
tasselled, lacquered, and the trappings of the
animals were gay, and sown with bells. It drew
up beneath the balcony on which, a moment ago,
the woman had leaned and laughed. Now she
had re-entered the lighted room behind her, and
the venetian doors were closed.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;That is the
<i>rath</i><a name="FNanchor_A_A" id="FNanchor_A_A"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_A_A" class="fnanchor">[A]</a>
of Babu Chandra Das,&quot;
remarked a bystander in a loud voice, for the crowd
had collected again. &quot;To-night he goes South,
and the woman goes with him, for is he not rich?
See, she comes forth.&quot;</p>

<div class="footnotes">
<div class="footnote">
<p><a name="Footnote_A_A" id="Footnote_A_A"></a>
<a href="#FNanchor_A_A">
<span class="label">[A]</span></a>
Bullock-carriage.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class="indent">The worm-eaten door of the house was pulled
half open from within, and an old and ugly native
female staggered out bearing an armful of bundles.
This, being unexpected, raised a laugh among the
youths.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page196" id="page196"></a>[pg&nbsp;196]</span>
During the little scene Coventry had stood by,
feeling half-dazed, sickened with the sight and the
scent of the violets, oppressed with a vague dread
that burdened his body and spirit. He made an
effort to turn to the syce and the pony that waited
with drooping head and trailing harness; but
something held him, kept him, as though his feet
were weighted, till she came out--the woman he
had seen on the balcony--and as she climbed into
the red-hooded carriage her veil fell back, and the
moonlight gleamed on her hair. It was then that
full recognition struck at George Coventry's heart
like the stab of a knife. The woman in the bazaar,
who lived in the street of the dancers and such-like,
who now drove away in the <i>rath</i> of Babu
Chandra Das, was Rafella, his wife of the years
that were over and dead.</p>

<p class="indent">His impulse was to run madly, blindly, after
her, but horror paralysed his limbs, and he saw,
as in an evil dream, the red hood with the swaying
curtains disappear into the shadows.</p>

<p class="indent">Coventry felt a touch on his arm.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What order, sahib? Protector of the poor,
what order?&quot; the syce was repeating.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Make some arrangement,&quot; said the sahib, at
last, mechanically; &quot;I will walk home.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">And mechanically, too, he walked up the street,
noticing nothing, not heeding the loitering figures
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page197" id="page197"></a>[pg&nbsp;197]</span>
that got in his way, that muttered abuse as he
moved them aside, till he came to the corner where,
years ago as it seemed to him now, his path had
been blocked by the camel caravan. As by instinct,
he turned into the principal thoroughfare, passing
in time by the house of rejoicing. It was quieter
now, the crowd had dispersed, the lights in the
pans had begun to burn low, and only a faint sound
of singing and music came from within the building.
With quick, regular tramp he continued his
way through the stifling city, meeting again the
odour of badly cured hides that drifted across from
the place of the workers in leather; on through the
hot, still streets that led to the squalid mud suburb
outside, and thence to the broad, empty road where
his steps sank soundless into the heavy dust.</p>

<p class="indent">He was barely conscious of physical being. All
the time, as he walked automatically through the
bazaars, mid the heat and the smells, his thoughts
had been chained to the past. Trixie might not
have existed--her puzzling absence, his quest, his
doubts and his apprehensions had gone from his
mind. He was living once more in those far-away
days that had begun with such happiness,
only to end in such failure and pain; they had
seemed to him over and dead, as leaves torn out
of his volume of life and destroyed, and now a
result had arisen, alive and awful and tragic--the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page198" id="page198"></a>[pg&nbsp;198]</span>
woman in the bazaar! Was it a dire pre-warning,
those words that had haunted his dreams and his
mind in the jungle, that had harassed him in the
train, followed him up to the door of his house?</p>

<p class="indent">Memory tortured his soul, sparing him
nothing. Again he found himself riding along
in a country lane on a summer morning in England;
he saw the vicarage garden, the tangle of
blossoming shrubs, the ragged riot of flowers, and
visioned a slender figure in blue crossing the
unkempt lawn, with hair glinting gold in the
sunshine. A clear young voice was trilling a verse
of an old, familiar hymn:</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i4">&quot;Other refuge have I none;</span>
<span class="i4">Hangs my helpless soul on Thee;</span>
<span class="i4">Leave, ah! leave me not alone,</span>
<span class="i4">Still support and comfort me.&quot;</span>
</div>
</div>

<p class="indent">He went through it all in hopeless, despairing
surrender--the simple wedding in the village
church, the period of placid happiness, and then
the doubt, the jealousy, the torment of suspicion,
culminating in that dreadful night--the night of
the ball. It returned to him now with cruel distinctness;
he could see Rafella running to the
door, her white arms lifted as she struggled with
the bolt; he heard her fleeing from him through
the compound....<span class="pagenum"><a name="page199" id="page199"></a>[pg&nbsp;199]</span>
&quot;Other refuge have I none----&quot; But she herself
had chosen to seek other refuge, knowing full
well what she did! Should he have tried to
prevent her, to understand her distress, her condition
of mind? She was frightened, indignant,
and helpless, whatever her fault; and he had
allowed her to go, had made no effort to save her,
because he was blinded with fury, was jealous and
hard, and perhaps unjust.... What was the
story of all those years? He sickened to think.
What had she suffered, endured, to bring her to
this--poor little fair Rafella, with her gentle ways
and her narrow knowledge of life?</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Still support and comfort me----&quot; He remembered
her protest--how shocked she had been
at his personal rendering of the words, how he
had said in the rain that morning--the morning
on which he had told her he loved her--that he
meant to protect and support her as long as he
lived. How had he kept his vow?</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Leave, ah! leave me not alone----&quot; Yes, he
had left her alone, had been harsh and unyielding,
without patience, without pity for the &quot;helpless
soul&quot;; he had put her away, condemned her
unheard, abandoned her to her fate....</p>

<p class="indent">He walked on, his head bent, his heart racked
with a sharp and terrible remorse; it was his fault,
his alone, that she had fallen to this hideous
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page200" id="page200"></a>[pg&nbsp;200]</span>
degradation; and now there was nothing he could
do. It was irredeemable, beyond his power to
cancel or to atone.</p>

<p class="indent">As he turned into the compound his consciousness
came back, as it were, to the present. The
bungalow stood dark and silent, just as he had left
it. Trixie was not there; he knew it, though he
went inside and called her. Alarm again assailed
him for her safety, and he paced the drive in
nervous agitation, fearing she was ill, that an accident
had happened. Never had she seemed so
dear, so precious to him; that he could have
mistrusted her at all now caused him shamed
contrition, and all his grudging of her gaieties
and freedom struck him at this moment in the
light of selfishness and petty tyranny. The recognition,
wakened by the bitter lesson of to-night,
of how in time he might have strained her love
and trust beyond endurance, filled him with acute
dismay and consternation.</p>

<p class="indent">If he only could know that Trixie was well,
had met with no harm. For the twentieth time he
went down the drive to the gate, and stood surveying
the road that stretched white between the
shadows of the trees to the right and to the left.
Away in the distance jackals were howling, and
over the plain in front of the house there floated
the regular beat of a tom-tom. The immediate
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page201" id="page201"></a>[pg&nbsp;201]</span>
silence around him, the moonlight, the heat, and
the faint, far sounds, seemed charged with a nameless
despondence that weighed on his soul. He
felt indescribably wretched and weary. Fever was
creeping again through his veins, and his limbs
and his head ached sorely. He turned at last and
went back to the house, intending to order a horse
to be saddled that he might set out again to search
for Trixie; but as he reached the veranda the sound
of wheels and the trotting of a horse came faintly
to his ears. He stood still and listened.</p>

<p class="h2a">THE OUTCOME</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Guy Greaves</span> and Trixie Coventry drove through
the gateless entrance to the colonel's compound,
that was sentinelled by whitewashed pillars built
of mud, and drew up sharply at the foot of the
veranda steps. Standing at the top of the steps
they perceived a tall figure, familiar even in the
ghostly light of a dying noon. At first Trixie
suspected that her imagination must have deceived
her; the next moment she realised that in truth it
was her husband. Why had George returned
so much sooner than he had intended? How long
had he been waiting here for her to come back?
She gave a little involuntary cry of consternation,
and called to him tremulously:</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;George, is that you? You are back? When
did you get back?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">There was something unusual about the manner
in which he descended the steps without giving
an answer. She thought he was shaking with
anger. When he spoke his voice sounded odd,
almost as though he were drunk.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page203" id="page203"></a>[pg&nbsp;203]</span>
&quot;I got back,&quot; he said slowly, picking his words
with care, &quot;not so very--not such a long time ago.
The servants said you were out--you had gone out
to dinner--with Mrs.--with Mrs. Roy----.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Trixie stood up in the dog-cart. George had
put out his hand to help her down; his face looked
haggard and drawn, his eyes were sunk deep in
his head. As she alighted he steadied her trembling
form, and glanced up at the young
man sitting, dumb with surprise and alarm, in
the trap.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Thank you for bringing my wife home,
Greaves,&quot; said Coventry, with laborious courtesy.
&quot;See you to-morrow, perhaps. Good-night.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Good-night, sir,&quot; came a respectful and relieved
response; and without looking back Guy
Greaves drove rapidly out of the compound.</p>

<p class="indent">Husband and wife stood alone on the steps of
their veranda. For a space neither of them uttered
a word. Trixie's heart beat painfully; she waited
for George to speak, almost choking with apprehension.
Was he dreadfully angry? What was
he going to say? Wild visions of futile explanations
and excuses, followed by disgrace, despair,
even perhaps divorce, crowded her mind and
rendered her weak and helpless. She yearned to
throw herself into his arms, to feel his lips on hers,
to weep out her love and her contrition on his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page204" id="page204"></a>[pg&nbsp;204]</span>
breast. He stood there beside her, handsome, tall,
to her adorable. Had she lost him through her
foolishness, her lack of will? She dared not
speak; a little sob was all the sound she made.
Then suddenly she became conscious that George
was swaying slightly as he stood. He began to
say something, still in that odd, unnatural voice,
but now the words were without coherence.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;George, are you ill?&quot; she asked in quick
concern, a concern that ousted all other distress for
the moment.</p>

<p class="indent">He put up his hand to his head which was
burning and throbbing with fever, and tried to
control his wandering senses. He wanted to speak
and tell Trixie not to be frightened. He was
vaguely aware that she feared his reproaches, his
anger; on her arrival her face and her voice had
betrayed it, and she had trembled, poor child, as
he helped her out of the dog-cart. He wanted to
ask her easily, gently, where she had been, what
had happened, with natural intonation, to make
her believe that whatever she told him, of course
he should quite understand. Instead he knew he
was saying something entirely different, and he
found himself powerless to prevent it. Trixie
looked dim, indistinct, and her voice sounded far
away, at the other end of the compound.</p>

<p class="indent">She was asking, alarmed and bewildered:
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page205" id="page205"></a>[pg&nbsp;205]</span>
&quot;What do you mean? Dearest, what is the
matter?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">He groped for her hand as though he were
blind. &quot;I was trying to tell you,&quot; he said thickly,
&quot;that I--that I&quot;--he made a desperate endeavour
to hold to his purpose, but failed--&quot;I wanted to
tell you about the woman in the bazaar.&quot; Then
he reeled; and his wife, exerting all her strength,
half supported, half dragged him to a chair.</p>

<hr />

<p class="indent">A fortnight went by, and at sunset one evening
Trixie Coventry came out of the bungalow to stroll
with lagging feet about the garden. She looked
white and weary, yet relief was in her eyes for
suspense was over, George was gaining strength.
His illness had been sharp, a vicious form of fever
contracted in the jungle and encouraged by the
journey, as well as by all that had followed on the
night of his return. For days and nights after his
collapse in the veranda he had either raved and
tossed, or lain exhausted and inert scarcely conscious
of existence. Fortunately a good nurse had
been available, and, as is usual in India, people
had been immeasurably kind and helpful. Yet the
strain had been severe for Trixie, the watching,
the anxiety, the long hot nights, the dread until
the doctor could, with truth, assure her that her
husband would not die; and underneath it all lay
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page206" id="page206"></a>[pg&nbsp;206]</span>
the harrowing uncertainty of what George had been
about to say to her when delirium had intervened.
Nothing in his wanderings had given her the
smallest clue. As frequently happens when sickness
causes derangement, the subject nearest his
mind had seemingly fled. He babbled of trifles,
of things that had never occurred, and complained
with fractious persistence that a tortoise-shell cat
with no eyes would sit on his bed.</p>

<p class="indent">Now that was all over, and the terrible weakness
that followed had been fought with uninterrupted
success, till now he was able to sit propped
up in a chair, though looking perhaps, as he said
himself, &quot;like a famine-relief-wallah--nothing but
eyes and bones.&quot; Yet, so far, he had uttered no
word to set Trixie's mind at rest on the subject
that haunted her thoughts and leavened her joy in
his convalescence. His manner, at least, was the
same as of old towards her, lover-like, and in addition
so grateful for all her care; but she was conscious
that sometimes when she was moving about
the room, his eyes were fixed on her with an expression
she could not define to herself, a mixture
of patient interrogation, and--was it doubt? Often
during the last two days, now that he was able to
talk without subsequent loss of strength, she had
resolved to make herself speak, and explain; but
always something had stopped her, either her
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page207" id="page207"></a>[pg&nbsp;207]</span>
courage had failed, or the nurse had come in, or
he had said something commonplace just at the
moment which seemed to render that moment unsuitable
for a confession.</p>

<p class="indent">Then this morning, just as she thought she had
nerved herself up to the point, he had suddenly
asked her to write to Guy Greaves.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Tell him I want to see him,&quot; he said; &quot;tell
him to try and come over this afternoon.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">She had glanced at him nervously, swiftly; his
voice told her nothing, he might have been bidding
her ask any one of his friends in the station to pay
him a visit. Also his head was bent, he was patting
one of the dogs, so his face was not visible.
Therefore she wrote the note without question or
comment, and wondered how Guy would feel when
he got it!</p>

<p class="indent">She avoided Guy when he arrived in the evening;
and now, while he sat with George, she was
strolling about in the garden, uneasy and restless.
The lawn looked scorched and hard, despite generous
watering that now seemed hardly worth the
labour and expense for the water only dried, hissing,
as it reached the earth, raising a little steamy
vapour that dispersed, leaving everything as hot
and dry and arid as before. The evening had
brought neither coolness nor sweet scents, and it
seemed difficult to determine whether the heat came
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page208" id="page208"></a>[pg&nbsp;208]</span>
from the dull yellow sky, or from the cracked
earth beneath. Birds stupefied with the close
atmosphere held open their dry beaks as though
gasping for breath, shrubs and trees drooped
thirstily.</p>

<p class="indent">Trixie noted it all with a sense of personal detachment
from her surroundings. The heat was
intensely trying, but this being her first hot weather
she did not suffer so much as if she had lived
longer in the country. She was suffering more
from the shock and the strain of George's illness
than from the actual heat, and also she awaited the
appearance of Guy Greaves from the house with an
agitation that was painful. Not that she feared
any longer such exaggerated possibilities as had
tortured her imagination on the night of her river
adventure with Guy, when her mental perspective
had been blurred by remorse and vexation. She
could almost have laughed, recalling the fear of
disgrace and divorce that had assailed her so
wildly; what harassed her now was the thought
that her husband might never believe in or trust
her again, that his confidence in her might never
be fully restored. And with this apprehension was
mingled a sense of resentment that George should
have sent for Guy to ask him about that tiresome
night on the river before she had told him herself.
Perhaps he imagined she did not intend to tell him
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page209" id="page209"></a>[pg&nbsp;209]</span>
at all, or perhaps he had planned to elicit the truth
from Guy, so that by no possibility could she deceive
him! Well, if that were his motive then
nothing should make her explain; she would
answer no questions, and offer no single excuse.
George could content himself with whatever he had
been able to get out of Guy; if he liked he might
even suspect her of waylaying Guy and concocting
the plausible story of accidental delay! The
old defiant temper arose within her, obliterating
for the moment all her late repentance and her
chastened mood.</p>

<p class="indent">She had worked herself into a state of unbearable
tension by the time she caught sight of Guy
Greaves in the veranda. He came down the steps
looking absurdly young; there was something
rather sheepish and ashamed in his demeanour,
like a schoolboy fresh from reproof concerning
some senseless prank. Trixie waited for him, feeling
angry and contemptuous. She would have liked
to bid him tell her nothing of what had passed between
himself and George, but human nature could
not be resisted.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well?&quot; she said with ungracious reluctance,
dispensing with formal greeting.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;How do you mean? How did I think he was
looking? It has knocked him about a bit certainly.
I got quite a shock at first when I saw
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page210" id="page210"></a>[pg&nbsp;210]</span>
him, but he declares he feels splendid, and he
talked no end. I hope it hasn't tired him awfully.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You know perfectly well what I mean. What
did he say to you about that night?&quot; She hated
herself for asking the question, and hated Guy
also for making her ask it.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;He said nothing at all about it.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What?&quot; cried Trixie, amazed and incredulous.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Fact,&quot; said Guy, and nodded his head, regarding
her gravely. &quot;I tell you I was in a blue funk
when I got your note, and you told me nothing
as to how the land lay. You might at least have
let me know that everything was all serene. He
never mentioned the subject, and, of course, I
wasn't going to begin.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Trixie's natural gumption failed her for once.
In the moment of sudden reaction, following on
her suspense and emotion, the fact escaped her
that Guy was assuming she had put matters right--had
explained the whole thing to the colonel's
complete satisfaction.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But&quot;--the words came from her lips involuntarily--&quot;I
felt certain he had sent for you to ask
you about it!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Good Lord! then you hadn't told him?&quot;
They gazed at each other in mutual discomfiture.
&quot;And he said he wished I'd take you for a drive
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page211" id="page211"></a>[pg&nbsp;211]</span>
because you'd been bottled up looking after him
all this time and it would do you good. By gad,&quot;
he concluded, &quot;he's a stunner, and to think that
we ever imagined----&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;How dare you say 'we'!&quot; cried Trixie unfairly.
&quot;Didn't I tell you it showed how little
you knew him?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well, you needn't rub it in,&quot; he protested;
&quot;and if it comes to that----&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Trixie flushed, and her eyes filled with tears.
&quot;Yes, I know,&quot; she said helplessly, &quot;it's no use
pretending----&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">For a few moments they stood silent, so motionless
that a grey squirrel whisked across the grass
between them and shot up the nearest tree elated
with his own daring. Daylight was fading
rapidly, in a short time it would be dark; the sultry
heat of the evening seemed to grow more oppressive.
Insects were humming around them, and
bats had begun to swoop low over the lawn.</p>

<p class="indent">Guy Greaves broke the pause. &quot;I suppose,&quot;
he said indiscreetly, &quot;it's too late now for a drive.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;<i>A drive!</i>&quot; echoed Trixie, with scorn. &quot;I'm
going in now to tell George what I think of myself--and
him.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;And what about me?&quot; asked the boy, a forlorn
sort of humour pervading his tone.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You don't count,&quot; Trixie told him with heartless
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page212" id="page212"></a>[pg&nbsp;212]</span>
 candour. &quot;Nobody in the world counts with
me except George.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">She moved towards the bungalow, a slender
white form in the dusk. Guy watched her go up
the steps; then he gave a little wistful sigh and
summoned his trap.</p>

<p class="indent">George was still in his chair when Trixie
entered the room. At the far end she could see
his head and shoulders silhouetted against the
opposite open door. The lamps had not yet been
lighted, and a powerful electric fan kept the air in
motion, creating a semblance of coolness. Was
he asleep? She stole softly round the back of the
chair and knelt by his side.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Trixie?&quot; His arm went round her; she
pressed her face against his.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Shall I tell you now,&quot; she asked, &quot;or are
you tired?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Tell away,&quot; he encouraged her cheerfully, in
prompt understanding.</p>

<p class="indent">There was a pause; then he found she was
crying.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Darling!&quot; he urged with concern. &quot;Whatever
you tell me I shall believe--of course.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, George, I love you, I love you; but I
was frightened. I didn't know what you might
think. Really I hadn't--hadn't done anything
<i>awfully</i> wrong.&quot;<span class="pagenum"><a name="page213" id="page213"></a>[pg&nbsp;213]</span>
&quot;I know, I know,&quot; he soothed with tenderness,
and waited, stroking her hair until she grew calmer.
&quot;Well? How did it happen? Don't tell me
unless you like; it won't make any difference.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, but I want to explain,&quot; she began once
more. &quot;You know, that evening, the night you
came back, it was so hot and so lonely, it seemed
as if the time would never go by--and I let myself
be persuaded into dining with that rowdy little
Roy woman. We all went on the river afterwards
because there was such a moon; and somehow, <i>not</i>
on purpose, I went in a boat alone with Guy
Greaves.&quot; She paused again, reluctant to &quot;give
away Guy,&quot; yet anxious to make no concealment.
The pause and a little unconscious movement
signified mental unease; Coventry guessed what
had followed and came to her aid.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;And then, I dare say,&quot; he suggested good-humouredly,
&quot;young Guy made an ass of himself,
and you were obliged to squash him?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, George, how did you know?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Never mind. Well, let us skip that part and
proceed. What happened next?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Then we got stuck on the sandbank. I
thought we should be there all night, perhaps till
after you had got home next day.&quot; She shivered,
recalling her anguish of mind.</p>

<p class="indent">Slowly the tale was unfolded, till she came to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page214" id="page214"></a>[pg&nbsp;214]</span>
the walk through the dust in the road, and then
she omitted, without hesitation, her quarrel with
Guy regarding her husband, and the qualms it
had caused her of which she was sorely ashamed;
so she unwittingly spared him a measure of extra
pain.</p>

<p class="indent">When she had finished he kissed her lips.
Words were not needed between them now. She
laid her head on his shoulder with a sigh of
supreme content, feeling ineffably happy....
The room was almost in darkness; the only sound
within it was the whirring of the fan.</p>

<p class="indent">Coventry drew his wife into his arms; he knew
she was wholly his. Love and tenderness flooded
his heart, that yet ached with a load that could
never be lightened. For even as he held her, sweet
and silent, to his breast, his conscience cried the
bitter truth--that always must he owe the saving
of her love, and of her trust, to the woman in the
bazaar.</p>
